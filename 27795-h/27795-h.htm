<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="upper">n</span> the matter of avowals the diffident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></span>
never speak if they can write. That
is why my apology for a furtive existence
is here set down in solitude instead of
being told face to face. You have borne so
many years with my unresponsive and incomprehensible
ways that shame at last constrains
me to this poor defence; for I must
either justify myself in your sight, or go far
away where even your kindness cannot reach
me. The first alternative is hard, but the
second too grievous for impaired powers of
endurance; I must therefore find what expression
I may, and tell you how my life has
been beshrewed ever since, a boy of twelve,
I first incurred the obloquy of being shy.
The word slips easily from the pen though
the lips refuse to frame it; for I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
most men would rather plead guilty to a
vice than to this weakness.</p>

<p>A doom of reticence is upon all our shy
confraternity, and we seldom make confidences
even to each other. It is only at
rarest intervals that the spell is lifted, by
silent sympathy, by a smile, by a tear, by I
know not what. At such times our souls
are like those deep pools of the shore, only
open to the sky at lowest tides of still
summer days, only to be approached across
long stretches of wet sand and slippery
shelves of rock. In their depths are delicate
fronded seaweeds and shells tinted with
hues of sundawn; but to see them you must
bend low over the surface, which no lightest
breath must furrow, or the vision is gone.</p>

<p>Few of the busy toilers of the world will
leave the firm sands to see so little; but
sometimes one weary of keen life will stray
aside, and oftener a child will come splashing
across the beach to peer down with
artless curiosity and delight. Then the
jealous ocean returns, and the still clear
depths are confused once more with refluent
waters; soon the waves are tossing above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the quiet spot, and the child is gone home
to sleep and forget. I cannot have you
with me at these still hours of revelation;
I must tell my tale as best I can with such
success as fortune may bestow.</p>

<p>I shall say nothing of the miseries which
embittered the life of the diffident boy.
But I cannot pass in silence the deeper
trouble of earliest manhood, when my soul
first awoke to the dread that though other
clouds might drift westward and dissolve,
one would impend over me for ever. It was
at the university that this vague misgiving
crept upon me like a chill mist, until the
hopes and aspirations of youth were one by
one extinguished, as to a sailor putting out
to sea the comfortable harbour lights vanish
in the wracks of a tempestuous winter
morning. I turned my face away from the
gracious young life amidst which I moved,
like a man possessed of a dark secret to his
undoing. My heart, yet eager for the joy
of living and yearning for affection, was
daily starved of its need as by a power of
deliberate and feline cruelty; and with
every expansive impulse instantly restrained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
by this d√¶monic force, I was left at last
unresponsive as a maltreated child, who
flings his arms round no one, but shrinks
back into his own world of solitary fancies.</p>

<p>I think there is no misery so great as that
of youth surrounded by all opportunities for
wholesome fellowship, endowed with natural
faculties for enjoyment, yet repressed and
thwarted at every turn by invincible self-consciousness
and mistrust: surely no lost
opportunities of manhood leave such aching
voids as these. In the spring-time of life
to feel day by day the slow erosion of the
power of joy is of all pains most poignant;
out of it grow anxieties, premature despairs,
incongruous with fresh cheeks and a mind
not yet mature. This misery was mine for
those four years which to most men are
the happiest of a whole career, but to me
at every retrospect seem so beset with
gloomy shadows that could I live my life
again, I would not traverse them once
more for all the gold of Ophir.</p>

<p>At first I writhed and strained in my
bonds, and sometimes would make timid
advances to the generous young hearts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
around me. But the tension always proved
too sore; I never maintained the ground
I had won, and with a perilous fatalism
more and more readily accepted what I
deemed inevitable failure. There were
among them, I doubt it not now, Samaritans
who would have tended my bruised limbs;
but then they all seemed to be gliding over
the black ice, too happy to stay and lift up
the fallen. And bruised though I was, I
still rose time and again and moved painfully
among them, so that theirs was no
culpable or merciless neglect.</p>

<p>Yet the end for me was illimitable dreariness;
and like Archie in <i>Weir of Hermiston</i>,
I seemed abroad in a world from which
every hope of intimacy was banished. And
as with every month the hopelessness of
resistance was made plainer and plainer,
there came upon me the recklessness of the
condemned man who jests or blasphemes to
hide his ruth. Overwrought continually by
forebodings of coming pain, unstrung by
strange revulsions, I would pass from burning
wrath to cold despair, a most petulant
and undisciplined sufferer. Uniting in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
person the physical exuberance of youth
and the melancholy of disillusioned manhood,
I was deprived of the balanced energy
proper to either age, and kept up a braggart
courage with the headiest wine of
literature. I could not bear the bland
homilies of the preachers, but ranged myself
with the apostles of rebellion who blew
imperious trumpet blasts before the walls of
ordered life.</p>

<p>Verily the violence of the blasts was
sometimes such that the ramparts should
have fallen down; and often in my exaltation
I already saw them totter, as I strode
along reciting the dithyrambs of men who
like myself could find scarce a responsive
heart-beat in all this throbbing world.
Above all I gloried in the declamations of
Queen Mab, which sanctioned by high
poetic authority the waste of my affections
and my moody defiance of life's most
salutary law. With these upon my lips
I roamed, an absurd pathetic figure, amid
the haunts of the Scholar Gipsy, and the
wayward upland breezes conspired with
my truant moods. And while I sat by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
my lamp late into the night, I turned
the pages of pessimists and cynics, for no
principles are dearer to a man than those
which allow him to profess contempt for
the benefits which he cannot enjoy.</p>

<p>Yet by seeking amid such simples a balm
for wounded pride, I did not really deceive
myself, but lived as a sophist rather than a
philosopher. And all the while I was
digging graves for my better instincts, until
my sexton's mood, confining me within
churchyard walls, gave me over almost entirely
to the company of mental bats and
owls. The danger of it all was that though
I was yet youthful, and should have been
still pliant as a sapling, I was fostering the
growth of those habits which, like rings in
the grain, are the signature of unyielding
years. Naturalists say that a bullfinch fed
only on hempseed gradually loses his fair
plumage and becomes black as a raven: so
my soul, nourished on thoughts of rebellion,
put off its bright and diverse enthusiasms and
was clothed in the dark garment of despair.</p>

<p>When the long-desired hour of release
came, and I was free to turn my back upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the spires of my prison city, I had already
plumbed an abyss of misery. The very
thought of life in the conflict of the world
was abhorrent; and if I had been of the
Roman Church I should have become a
Benedictine and sought a lettered and
cloistered peace. I despaired of finding
anywhere upon earth the profound quietude,
the absolute detachment, when a chance
occasion seemed to crown my desire, and
blind to all warnings of disillusion, I suddenly
set sail for what I then thought
might be a permanent sojourn in the East.</p>

<p>Within two months' time the whole
environment of my life was changed, and
I was established on a lonely plantation set
high upon a range of hills whose slopes
were clothed with primeval forests verging
to a tropical sea. My home, a white-walled,
red-roofed bungalow with a great
columned verandah like a temple's peristyle,
lay in the issue of an upper valley threaded
by a clear stream, whence you may look
far down over rolling plains to an horizon
lost in the shimmering heat of noon. Immediately
to the east rose the cone of a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
solitary hill, always outlined against the
sky with a majestic isolation that lent it an
almost personal existence, and at the birth of
every day bearing the orb of the rising sun
upon its wooded shoulder. Round about,
in scattered villages of thatched and mud-walled
huts, dwelled brown men of ancient
pagan ways, men who neither knew progress
nor set any price upon time.</p>

<p>There I entered upon a wholly new
existence as remote from all the social trials
which beset shyness as if it were passed in
some island of the uttermost sea. I had
escaped from a harrying pursuit; I was
free; and to the bliss of this recovered
liberty I abandoned myself, without attempting
to justify my flight to conscience
or forming any scheme for future
years. Like a deer which has eluded the
hounds, I yearned only for rest and long
oblivion of the chase; I wanted to live
woodland days until, all the strain and panic
of the past forgotten, I might rise refreshed
and see a new way clear before me.</p>

<p>And this first abandonment was a time
of ecstasy. The long tranquil days were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
crowned by nights of peace yet more
desired. I lay beneath the verandah and
watched the stars in their splendour, not
the pin-points of cold light that pierce our
misty western heavens, but bright orbs in
innumerable companies hovering upon the
tranced earth. Night after night I saw the
incomparable vision; month after month
the moon rose slowly over the high wall of
the jungle, first a great globe imminent
upon the trees, next soaring remote through
the upper heavens, waning at last to a sphere
of pale unquickening light. I would lie
thus for hours motionless, with lulled mind,
until the breeze forerunning the dawn, or
the quavering wail of the jackal, recalled
the startled thought to the prison bonds
of self.</p>

<p>With the gentle lapse of months all
these impersonal influences took dominion
over me and gave me a quiet happiness
never known before. The nights brought
the greater light; but the days too had
their glories. I would climb the rugged
sides of the mountain, and emerging into
a colder world sit beneath an overhanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
rock and see the hot air quivering over
leagues of plain; while in the nearer
distance, far down beneath my feet, the
rice-fields shone like emerald and the palm-fringed
pools like shields of silver. Or I
would stretch myself at early afternoon on
the close-cropped grass on the jungle-edge,
and watch the opposite sky take on an ever-deeper
blue against the setting sun behind
me. Often at such times I would hear
a rushing in the highest branches, and
turning very silently, see the outposts of
a troop of monkeys peering down through
the gleaming foliage. Then, if I moved,
neither head nor limb, others would come,
and yet others, leaping from branch to
branch and plunging down from higher to
lower levels like divers cleaving a deep
green sea; until at last some slightest
involuntary movement of mine would put
the whole host to flight, and greybeards,
young warriors, camp followers and mothers
with their children on their backs would
spring precipitate from tree to tree, screaming
and gibbering like Homer's sapless
dead. Then, when the stars rushed out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and the darkness came on apace, it was sweet
to wander home along those paths so dear
to primitive men in all countries, narrow
paths and sinuous, smoothed by the footfalls
of centuries, winding patiently round every
obstacle and never breaking through after
the brutal manner of civilization. The fire-flies
gleamed in the brushwood on either
hand, and from every side rose that all-pervading
hum of busy insects through
which the tropic forest is never still.</p>

<p>Amid these surroundings, so peaceful and
so new, my soul was stilled to that <ins title="gal√™n√™">&#947;&#945;&#955;&#8053;&#957;&#951;</ins>
or ocean-calm which the old Greek philosopher
found the highest good for man. And
month by month the mere material side of
life grew of less moment; the body fretted
the spirit less, but often seemed a tissue of
gossamer lightness through which it could
pass at will, as the breeze through the gleaming
spider-webs upon the bushes at dawn.
There were times when the ideal of the
mystic seemed well-nigh accomplished, when
my body might almost have been abandoned
by the soul for hours upon end. The
words of Emerson seemed to be fulfilled:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
"By being assimilated to the original soul
by whom and after whom all things subsist,
the soul of man does then easily flow into
all things and all things flow into it: they
mix; and he is present and sympathetic
with their structure and law."</p>

<p>As I write now amid the roar of London
traffic, I well believe that to men who
have never bathed in eastern moonlight,
the description will sound hyperbolical and
false. But when I think of those old days,
how serene they were, how apart, I let
the words stand: I am not artist enough
to give them a more plausible simplicity.
All conditions that a recluse might crave
seemed now to be fulfilled for my benefit.
The virgin forests and great hills were a
perpetual joy, but there was a tranquil
pleasure in the plantation which man's
labour had reclaimed from these. That
was a meet place indeed for the meditation
of a quiet hour, and no more grateful
refuge can be conceived than such a shady
grove at the height of noon. You must
not fancy an expanse of dusty land lined
with prim rows of plants in the formal style<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of a nursery garden; but, spread over the
lower slopes of the valleys, spacious woods
of clean, grey-stemmed trees, with overarching
branches thinned to cast a diaphanous
shade over the sea of lustrous dark
leaves below. The shrubs stood waist-high
in serried, commingling ranks, their dark
burnished leaves gleaming here and there
in the sifted rays that found their way
down through the vaults of foliage; the
groves of Daphne had no more perfect
sheen.</p>

<p>I learned to feel for this gracious place
a love only second to that of the wilder
jungle; for nature thus tamed to work side
by side with man loses indeed her austerer
charm, but not her calm and dignity:
these she brings with her always to be a
glory to the humblest associate of her
labour. Often as I pruned a tree, or
stripped its stem of suckers, I felt the
soothing, quickening influence of this
partnership, and my thoughts turned to
others who had known a like satisfaction
and relief; to Obermann forgetting his
melancholy in the toil of the vintage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
plucking the ripe clusters and wheeling
them away as if he had never known the
malady of thought; or to Edward Fitzgerald
out with the dawn among his roses
at Little Grange.</p>

<p>Amid these high dreams and simple occupations,
time seemed to glide away like a
brimming stream, and the only events that
marked the passing of the years were wayfarings
through the country-side, sojournings
in strange, slumbrous native towns,
expeditions of wider range to old white
ports of Malabar still dreaming of the forgotten
heroes whose story Camoens sang.
After many such journeys the genius of
this oriental land seemed to travel with us,
so familiar did every aspect of this simple
Indian life become. Our equipment was
of set purpose the patriarchal gear of native
fashion; narrow carts with great lumbering
wheels were covered by matting arched
upon bent saplings, and had within a depth
of clean rice-straw on which at night mattresses
were spread. Beneath each yoke
went a pair of milk-white oxen with large
mild eyes and pendulous dewlaps, great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
beasts of a fine Homeric dignity and worthy
of Nausicaa's wain. They swung along
with a leisurely rolling gait; and if their
silent feet moved too slowly, the sleepy
brown-skinned driver, crouching on the
pole between them, would shame them
into speed by scornful words about their
ancestry, more prompt than blows in their
effect on beasts of ancient and sacred lineage.</p>

<p>We travelled at night or in the freshness
of early morning, regardless of the hours,
unfretted by the tyrannous remembrances
of appointed times. Milestones passed
slowly, like things drifting, which ask no
attention, and hardly perceived in the
moment of their disappearance, serve only to
enrich and replenish the mind's voluptuous
repose. It was a joy to lie drowsily back
upon the straw, awaiting sleep and looking
out upon the stars through the open back
of the cart, while the fire-flies darted across
the feathery clusters of bamboo, and the
cradling sound of wheels and footfalls called
slumber up out of the darkness. And it
was equal delight to spring from the cart at
first flush of dawn, and see some far blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
hill in the east lined like a cloud with
broadening gold, until the resistless sun rose
a full orb above it, flooding the grey plains
and making the leaves of the banyans gleam
with the lustre of old bronze. But though
the sun was come, we would often press on
for yet three hours, through belts of squirrel-haunted
wood, beside great sheets of water
with wild-duck floating far amidst, and borders
starred with yellow nenuphars, across
groves of mango and plantain trees into
landscapes of tiny terraced plots, where the
vivid green rice-blades stood thick in the
well-soaked earth, and bowed brown figures
diverted to their roots the thread-like rivulet
from the great brown tank above.</p>

<p>Here would be a wayside shrine, a simple
stuccoed portico with columns streaked in
red, enclosing the sacred emblems with their
offerings of golden marigold, and bearing
upon each corner, carved in dark grey stone,
Siva's recumbent bull. Here millet fields,
with hedges of blue aloe or euphorbias like
seven-branched candlesticks, announced a
place of habitation; soon the village itself
appeared, a long irregular line of white-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>walled
houses roofed with thatch or tile,
and here and there greater dwellings with
carved balconies and barred verandahs, behind
which impassive white-robed figures
sat and seemed to ponder upon life. On
the right, perhaps, would be a shop all
open to the road, where, cross-legged upon
a kind of da√Øs, the merchant sat among his
piled wares, unenterprising and unsolicitous,
serenely confident in the balance-sheet of
fate. On the left, in a shady corner, a
barber would be bending over a half-shaven
skull. Everywhere children of every
shade from yellow to deep umber would be
playing solemnly about the ways, turning
upon the passing stranger their grave, unfathomable
eyes.</p>

<p>Beyond the village there would be a rest-house
maintained for the use of wayfaring
white men, and here we would repose through
the heat of the day, reclining with a book
in rooms shaded with shutters, or with fine
mats drenched from hour to hour with
cooling sprays of water. Then with the
sun's decline we would set out once more,
meeting a file of blue-robed women erect as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
caryatides as they came up from the well, each
bearing upon her back-thrown head a water-jar
of earthen or brazen ware, staying her
burden with a shapely brown arm circled
with bangles of glass and silver. In the
short hours before the darkness, we would
encounter all the types of men which go
to make up Indian country life&mdash;the red-slippered
banker jogging on his pony beneath
a white umbrella, the vendor of palm-wine
urging a donkey almost lost beneath the
swollen skins, barefooted ryots with silent
feet and strident tongues, crowds of boys
and children driving buffaloes and cows, all
coming homeward from their labour with
the evening.</p>

<p>And when these had gone by, and we
rolled on through the scented air of the
silent open country, we would come perhaps
in the gathering darkness to a great
river lapping and murmuring through the
blackened rocks above the ford, and shining
like a glorious path in the light of the rising
moon. Silently, high above the banks,
there would flit through the still air bands
of flying foxes awakened for their nightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
raid upon the plantain groves; and in the
shadows of the further bank there would
gleam a sudden light, or the echoes of a
hailing voice would rise and then die away.
Steeped in the poetry of all these things
we would cross and emerge upon the
opposite slope to begin the pilgrimage of
the night anew. So to live tranquil days
and unfretful, moving in quiet through a
still land rich in old tradition&mdash;this was an
experience of peace which no dreams of
imagination could surpass, a freshness of joy
penetrative as the fragrance of unplucked
wayside flowers.</p>

<p>Sometimes we would set out on longer
journeys by land and sea, crossing the
wooded ghats and descending to some old
port of historic name, Cochin or Mangalore
or Calicut, white places of old memory,
sleeping by the blue waves as if no Vasco
de Gama had ever come sailing up out of
the West to disturb their enchanted slumber.
The approach to these dreamy shores was
dark and tumultuous, as if nature had
set an initiation of contrasting toil before
the enjoyment of that light and peace. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
followed the bed of a mountain stream, which
began in a mere pleat of the hills, tumbling
often in white cascades, and enduring
no boat upon its waters until half its course
was run. But here it challenged man to
essay a fall; for where it burst its way
over rocky slopes were channels jeopardous
and hardly navigable, sequences of foaming
rapids, races of wild water swirling round
opposing boulders, and careering indignant
of restraint between long walls of beetling
rock. Here when the sun had gone down
we would embark with a crew of lithe brown
men in a boat hewn from a single tree,
seamless and stoutly fashioned to be the
unharmed plaything of such rocks and
boisterous waters as these. In these rapids
the river waked to consciousness of mighty
life, tossing our little craft through a riot of
dancing waves, whirling it round the base of
perpendicular rocks set like adamant in the
hissing waters, sweeping it helpless as a petal
down some glassy plane stilled, as it were,
into a concentrated wrath of movement.
The men sprang from side to side, from bow
to stern, staving the craft with a miraculous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
deftness from a projecting boulder, forcing
her into a new course, steadying her as she
reeled in the shock and strain of the conflict,
while their long poles bent continually like
willow wands against her battered sides.
The steersman stood silent, except when he
shouted above all the din some resonant,
eruptive word of command; the men responded
by breathless invocations to their
gods, relaxing no tense sinew until the pent
waters rushed out into some broad pool
where the eased stream went brimming
silently, gathering new strength in the
darkness of its central deeps.</p>

<p>At such places the moon would perhaps be
obscured by passing clouds, and we would
land upon an eyot until she shone once more
in a clear heaven. Stretched at length upon
the fine white sand waiting for her return,
we could hear the boom of waters in the
distance calling us on to a renewal of the
conflict. These periods of great stillness,
interposed between tumults past and impending,
had their own refinement of
pleasure as far above the joys of fenced
and covenanted ease as the bivouac of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
hard campaign surpasses slumber in the fine
linen of a captured city: they brought
the wandering mind into communion with
elemental forces, and seemed to hold it
expectant of supernatural events. In that
interlunar twilight there reigned a solemn
sense of wonder evoked here eternally, one
felt, from the ancient time, with the rustling
of stirred foliage and the voice of those far
waters for its music.</p>

<p>The lulled reason yielded place to reverie,
and the whole rapt being abandoned itself
like an Orphic worshipper to the guidance of
an unseen mysteriarch. This acquiescence
in the swift succession of calm to fury and
stress, resembled the quiet which may be
conceived to follow sudden death; the
heightened sense of vicissitude in things
summoned up and sustained a solemn mood.
All the while that we lay charmed and half
oppressed in this atmosphere as of an under-world,
the clouds were drawing forward on
their course; and as their last fringe trailed
slowly by and the moon was revealed once
more, the spell was broken in an instant
by human voices calling us to re-embark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Again we glided to the verge of tumultuous
falls, again we were flung through foaming
narrows and labyrinthine passages of torn
rocks, until, the last promontory turned
with arrowy swiftness, we shot through a
postern of the granite barrier and bounded
far into still water fringed with trees of
profoundest shadow. We put in to shore,
for this stage of our journey was over; the
dawn was near; the carts stood waiting
on the road. But the influence of the
wonderful night, clinging about us, would
keep us long silent, as if awed by the passing
of ancient Vedic gods.</p>

<p>I will not describe the later stages of these
journeys: the coasting voyages in restful
ships that seemed built to sail M√¶ander;
the touchings at old wharfless ports; the
visits to lone temples where Herodotus
would have loved to linger; the rambles on
the slopes of Adam's Peak; the meditations
amid the ruins of Anaradhapura and
Pollanarrua, ancient homes of kings, now
stripped of every glory but that of these
sonorous names&mdash;such are the records of
every traveller, and are chronicled to satiety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
by a hundred hasty pens. A month of
wandering within the fringe of civilization
would be closed by a last week of patriarchal
travel, bringing us back to our remote valley
just as the clouds of the coming monsoon
were ranging in denser ranks along the
evening sky like the tents of a beleaguering
army. Hardly had we time to settle down
for the wet season, see to the stacking of
fire-logs, and be sure that every tile on the
roof was firm in its appointed place, when
the embattled host seemed to break up from
its last camp, and advance upon us along
the whole line that the eye perceived.</p>

<p>One year I was witness of the first onset,
which came in the late afternoon&mdash;an
immediate shock of massed clouds without
throwing forward of skirmishers or any prelude
of the vanguard. Our home looked
down upon a gentle incline of open grassy
land to a broad belt of jungle in the middle
distance; here the undergrowth and small
trees had been newly cleared away, opening
out a dim far view across an uncumbered
leaf-strewn floor into the backward gloom
of the forest. I sat with my eyes fixed upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the trees, drawing the rain on with the
whole strength of desire to the parched
country lying there faint with the exhaustion
of three months of drought. While
I watched, the deep line of cloud, at first
distinct from the forest-top along which it
came rolling, insensibly merged with the
foliage, until every contour was lost in a
common gloom, only the great bare stems
below standing pale against the gathering
darkness. There was an intense stillness
everywhere like the silence of expectation
which falls upon an awestruck crowd; the
very insects had ceased their usual song.
And now the ear caught a distant sound,
vague and deep, coming up out of the mid
darkness, and growing to a mighty volume
as a sudden wind swept out from the
sounding foliage into the open land and
searched every cranny of the house as it
passed. Then, as if drawn by the wind,
there came into view among the nearest
tree-stems a moving grey line advancing
with a long roar until it hid the whole
forest from sight: it was the wave of battle
about to break upon us. It came on like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
a wall, enormous, irresistible; one instant,
and it had devoured the intervening space;
another, and we were lost in the deluge,
and the great rain drops were spilled
upon the roof with the noise of continuous
thunder. As the deep sound reverberated
through the roof above me, I went in exulting
to a hearth piled with blazing logs,
glad in the prospect of renewing for many
weeks old and quiet habitudes of indoor
life, rich with solace of books and tranquil
meditation.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>I have dwelt upon the outward aspects of
my life in exile, because the sojourn of these
years amid the hills and forests taught a
natural leechcraft which was to stand me in
good stead in coming years, and may stand
in equal stead other souls desolate as mine.
Like the Nile brimming over the fields, a
flood of joy from nature overlaid my parched
being, enriching it with a fertile loam, and
shielding it from the irritations of the world.
I lay fallow beneath the still, sunlit waters,
unharrowed by teasing points of doubt, and
porous to the influence of an all-encom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>passing
peace. Exile had opened to me a
new heaven and a new earth, whose freshness
and calm charmed thought away from all
vain questionings; the fascination of outward
things had for a while cooled the
useless ardour of introspection. But it was
inevitable that the bland ease of such a
contemplative life should bring no enduring
satisfaction to the mind; it was not an end
in itself, but a mere means to serenity, a
breathing-space useful to the recovery of
a long-lost fortitude. The time was now
come when the hunted deer, refreshed in
the quiet of his inaccessible glen, was to
awake to new thought of the herd, and of
the duties of a common life; when the
peace of successful flight was to appear in
its true light as a momentary release, and
no longer as the ultimate goal imagined in
the anguish of pursuit.</p>

<p>It was during this last monsoon that
doubts began to stir within, interrupting
my studies of the systems of Hindu philosophy
and my porings over sacred books.
The vague insistence of these misgivings
made me surely aware that even in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
eastern paradise all was not well; but at
first I refused to listen, and plunged deep
into the maze of the Vedanta to escape the
importunate voice. Yet anxiety came up
around me like a heavy atmosphere; an
indescribable sense of disillusion, clinging as
a damp mist, brought its mildew to the soul,
until my new heaven was overcast and my
new earth dispeopled of all pleasures. Then
one day the fever struck me down, and of a
sudden my mind became an arena in which
memories of earlier life chased one another
unceasingly in the round of a delirious dance.
Trivial events impressed themselves on consciousness
with strange precision; objects
long forgotten rose before me outlined in fire&mdash;one,
a pane of stained glass in Fairford
Church, with a lost soul peering in anguish
through the red bars of hell. Each and
every apparition was of the old life; all were
emissaries from the forsaken West summoning
me back to my renounced allegiance.
When the fever left me, returning reason
slowly brought order amid the welter of
confused ideas, as the ants sorted the grain
for distracted Psyche, and for the first time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
I considered in the detachment of reminiscence
the nature of my action in leaving
England. I sifted the evidence at length as
I lay under the verandah slowly recovering
strength; and when at last judgment was
delivered, it took the necessary form of condemnation.</p>

<p>I saw now that unless a man is prepared
to discard every western usage, to
slough off his inherited cast of thought,
to renounce his faith, wholly and finally
to abandon his country and his father's
house, his flight is but the blind expedient
of cowardice or pride. Here and there may
be born one who can so cut himself off
from the parent stem as to endure a fruitful
grafting upon an oriental stock, but I knew
that I at least was none such. I was no
more prepared for so uncompromising a
renunciation than any other weakling who
seeks prestige by parade of exotic wisdom,
and deems himself a seer if he can but
name the Triad, or tell the avatars of Vishnu,
I had not the credulity which may justify
the honest renegade, and the western blood
still ran too warmly in my veins. I felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
that were I to stay in the East for fifty years,
I should never reach the supreme heights of
metaphysical abstraction whence men really
appear as specks and life as a play; therefore
to remain was to avow myself a runaway
and to live henceforth despicable in my own
eyes. For over the unfathomable deep of
oriental custom the torrent of our civilization
flows unblending, as in the Druid's
legend the twin streams of Dee flow clear
through Bala lake, and never mingle with
its waters. Not for our use is that intricate
mind which in logic needs more than two
premises to a conclusion, and in art is intolerant
of all void space, entangling its
figures in labyrinths of ornament which
Maya herself might have devised to distract
the sight from truth.</p>

<p>The Hindu has the true dignity of contemplation,
and superbly removes himself
from the sordid greeds of life. But in
imagining and reviling an abstraction called
Matter, he abides in the errors of the first
Greek sages, and mines so far beneath the
trodden earth that when he looks up into
middle day he sees only the stars above him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Could I have shared the eremite's belief
that his prayers help not merely his own
solitary soul but all souls travailing through
all the world, I might yet have remained
where I was, an alien living indifferent to
the common rule, like a monk of some
shunned exotic order. But with convictions
like mine, to do so would have brought the
drear sense of derogation. All the miseries
of the past were as nothing to that; there
was but one manly course&mdash;to return and
gird my loins for a new struggle with western
life. Within a month from the time when
this course was seen to be a duty, I was
standing on the deck of a homeward-bound
steamer, watching the harbour lights recede
into the distance.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Back once more in England, I threw
aside the clinging robe of meditation, and
falling upon work ravenously, indulged what
genius of energy was still alive within
me. I made haste to adore all that I had
so lately burned, making life objective,
revering personal ideals, and in the ordinance
of material things finding the truest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
satisfaction of all endeavour. I saw in
civilization the world's sole hope; its brisk
life and abounding force took sudden hold
of a fancy enervated by dreams. Again I
found a new heaven and a new earth,
though earth was now no more than man's
dinted anvil, and heaven his reservoir of
useful light. I lived for action and movement;
I mingled eagerly with my fellows,
and cursed the folly which had driven me
to waste three years in an intellectual swoon.
Now the day was not long enough for work,
Lebanon was not sufficient to burn. I saw
the western man with race-dust on his
cheeks, or throned in the power-houses of
the world, moving upon iron platforms and
straight ladders in the mid throb and tumult
of encompassing engines. One false step,
and he must fall a crushed and mutilated
thing. Yet unconcerned as one strolling
at large, he controlled the great wheels
and plunging pistons, and brought them
to a standstill with a touch of his finger.
The confidence and strenuous ease of such
life compelled me to marvel and admire,
and I who had so lately lain at the feet of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
eastern sages, set up this mechanician as
my god. If I looked back at all to the
land of dreams, the placid figure beneath
the Tree of Enlightenment took on the
aspect of a fool's idol, ignobly self-manacled,
pitiful and irksome in remembrance.</p>

<p>But if once more I dreamed of finality
in change I deceived myself, forgetting
that God Himself cannot unmake the past
or undo what is done. A year had hardly
gone by in this new apprenticeship to life,
when at moments of weariness or overstrain
sharp doubts shot through me and
were gone again, like twinges of sudden
pain recalling old disease to one who
has lulled himself with dreams of cure.
The feeling of fellowship with men grew
weaker, and as it waned I began to shrink
once more from my kind. I still believed
myself happy, but happiness seemed to
need constant affirmation, as though it
could make no way in my favour without
display of token or credential to confirm its
truth. There were pauses in the clatter
and jangle of life; the revolutions of the
great wheels sometimes slowed into silence;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and as these interludes grew more frequent,
I caught myself repeating that I really was
content. The faint assurance given, I flung
myself with devouring industry upon my
allotted task, trying to stifle the forebodings
which prophesied against my peace.</p>

<p>In one such pause my old self appeared
before me again, like the face of an ancient
enemy looking in from the darkness;
stealthy footfalls which of late I had so
often seemed to hear were now referred
to their true cause as we saw each other
eye to eye. The old Adam had awakened
and was come for his inheritance; and the
vision of him there across the pane gazing
in upon his own, seemed to arraign me
for disowning a brother and denying his
indefeasible right. I recognized that with
this familiar form cold reason had returned
to oust the hopes and emotions which had
usurped her office. My rush for freedom
had ended, as such sallies often do, in exhaustion,
capture and despair; upon the
thrill and thunder of the charge followed
the silence of the dungeon and the anguish
of stiffening wounds. The truth, so simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
written that a child might have spelled it,
lay clear before me: I had left reformation
till too late. I was too old to change.</p>

<p>Even a few years before, I might have
dashed out, like Marmion, from the prison-fortress;
but now the opportunity was past
and the portcullis was down. My character
with all its faults was formed within me;
and the very years which I had passed in the
wilderness, instead of averting the danger,
had set the final seal upon my fate, for
when a man has reached a certain point in
life he is intractable to the reforming hand.
But though at last I knew myself beaten,
and helpless in the hands of an implacable
power, I fluttered like a wounded bird and
sought wildly for a loophole of escape. I
could no longer hope to stand alone against
destiny; that conceit was gone: could I
find a comrade to help me through the
press and lift me when I fell? But here
the invincible pride of shyness barred the
way, forbidding alike any confession of
weakness or any appeal to man's compassion.
I could not bring myself to say: I am unable
to rule my life, do you undertake it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
for me. Was marriage a conceivable path
of redemption? I had never envisaged it
before, but now, in my desperation, I
dreamed it for a moment a possible issue.
I even fixed upon the person who should
thus save me from myself, and beguiled
many lonely hours by picturing her charms
and enumerating her noble qualities.</p>

<p>She lived in a country house where I
had been several times a guest, and she
had one of those faces which, in Gray's
beautiful expression, speak the language of
all nations. Her features had that sunny
charm which thaws mistrust; she was
dowered with all graces and sweet qualities;
and you could no more have doubted the
immanent nobility of her nature than you
could have dreamed a stain in the texture
of a white petal. And with all her gentleness
there was present I know not what
sign and promise of strength, waking in
those who saw her an intuitive trust in
loyalty of uttermost proof. She would
have flamed indignant against evil, but
only evil could have moved her from that
equal poise of soul which made her entrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
into a room the prelude to higher thoughts
and finer feelings. She was naturally kind
without consciousness of a mission, neither
seeking to enslave nor enfranchise, but by
a silent outflowing of goodness ennobling
whatever company she was in. Nor was
her tongue the prattling servant of her
beauty, but a guide of cheerful converse;
for just as she charmed without device
or scheme of fascination, so she possessed
the art of speaking well without seeming
to have ever studied it. In the chase after
just and felicitous ideas, she could lead or
follow over the most varied fields with the
intuition of the huntress born. With all
these excellences, her wit, her sincerity, her
ardour for all things bright and true, she
had no conceit of herself but kept her
father's house in gladness and loved the
country-side.</p>

<p>To her, in these days of imminent dismay,
my thoughts flew out as to a fair protecting
saint; until the inspiration of her visionary
presence wrought in my fancy with such a
dramaturgic power, that I seemed to walk
daily with her, and to know all those delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and sweet propinquities by which liking
passes into affection and affection is glorified
into love. So far did these happy day-dreams
carry me, that they brought me to
the extreme of imaginary bliss, and poured
out for me the wine of untempered joy
which thrills the hearts of lovers on the
verge of their betrothal. The dreams that
followed that magic draught denied me
no convincing touch of circumstance, and
projected upon a credible and familiar
scene the bright possibilities to which fate
denied a real existence. The scene was
always the same, and the words and movements
which entranced me followed each
other with almost religious exactitude of
detail which the adult demands of his
day-dreams and the child of the fairy-tale
he loves.</p>

<p>It was always a June afternoon when we
went out together, into the meadows near
her home; she moving with fluent grace
as befitted a daughter of the woods, her
eyes indrawing joy from all nature, her
hair reflecting rich gold of the sunlight, her
whole face lit with the pleasure of a bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
hour; I a mere satellite attendant upon
its central star. We strolled through the
four home-meadows, crossed a high-banked
lane and a dingle with a brook running
down it, and then from an open common
flooded with sunlight passed into a wood of
tallest beeches. In that cool, shadowy place
the sun, searching a way through crannies
in the upper verdure, chequered with
patches of silver light the even mast-strewn
floor. The multitude of smooth grey stems
rose aligned like cathedral columns; and the
grateful dimness of the wood, succeeding the
glare of day, wakened a sense of purposed
protection and quietude pervading all things,
which soothed the mind with the illusion
that this was a sacred spot appointed for an
offering of souls. Near one of those isles
of sunlight we lingered; and as she looked
up to the source of light, the movement
brought her face near the slanting shaft of
rays, until there was set round it an aureole
of dancing beams. It seemed to me at this
part of my dream that there came to both
of us some gracious influence, for as her
eyes met mine they dropped again, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
were fixed for a moment upon the wild
flowers she carried. Then my heart began
to beat and my whole being to grow greater:
impassioned words, to that hour unconceived,
came rushing to my lips; the fire
and glory of a new manhood were kindling
in me to the transformation of my nature&mdash;when,
in the very moment of utterance,
a sheer barrier of doom descended between
me and my joy; the fire was quenched,
and my soul was poured out within me.</p>

<p>To this fatal point my fancy always
brought me and no further, that coming
thus to the threshold of the house of joy
and hearing the bars shoot into their sockets
I might thoroughly know my ineffectual self
and leave untouched the forbidden latch.
So far I came in my dream times without
number; and always on the verge of joy
there came that doom, and the shooting of
those adamantine bolts.</p>

<p>Yet all the while I wove it, I knew that
this texture of dreams must soon be drawn
aside, and like the curtain in the tragedy
reveal at last the horror concealed within.
Such brooding was but the deception of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
reluctant spirit dallying and delaying with
any trifle by the way to put off the arrival
at the hill of evil prospect. At last I
learned the lesson of this abrupt ending to
the dream at the point of full disillusion;
it forced itself upon me with the power of
an oracular utterance warning me to cease
my palterings with fate. My reason now
rebuked me like a stern judge, dissecting all
false pleas and laying bare their weakness.
What right had I, now knowing myself
incurable, even to dream of easing my own
pain by darkening and despoiling a second
life? The love of solitude was now more
to me than even the love of a wife; it
would surely come between us like a strange
woman, and fill a pure heart with bitterness.
No smiling hopes of a possible redemption
could annul the immutable decree, and if
I disobeyed the warning, guilt as well as
misery would be mine; for he is pitiful
indeed who only weds that his wife may
suck the poison from his wounds. If I
married I should stand for ever condemned
of an unutterable meanness. So I dispelled
my dreams and looked reality in the face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a dismal prospect that lay before
me. Until then the future had held its
possible secrets, its imaginable revelations
of change, which, like the luminous suggestions
in dark clouds, allured with a promise
of a brief and penetrable gloom. In my
darkest hours I had lulled fear by the
thought of a haply interposing Providence,
and drifted on from day to aimless day
nursing the hope of some miraculous release
upon the very steps of the scaffold. But
now I was twice fallen; and as a man
abandoned by the last illusion of deliverance
calls ruin to him, and in the new leisure
of despair calmly scans the features at which
but now he dared not glance, so I saw as in
a hard grey light the true outlines of my
destiny. The wreathing mist, the profound
soft shadows, the clouds with their promise
of mutability, were now all gone, leaving
the bare framework of a world arid and
severe as a lunar landscape.</p>

<p>I seemed to be sitting in the dust, as
in inmost Asia a sick man may crouch
abandoned, while the caravan in which all
his earthly hopes are centred goes inex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>orably
upon its way. The blue sky flushes
to deep purple before him; night falls;
all colour is swallowed up in darkness, until
the jingling camel-bells receding up the
pass cross the dividing ridge, and for him
the last silence is begun. Such then was
the end of youthful ambition: for food a
mouthful of ashes instead of the very
marrow of joy; for home not the free
ocean, but a stagnant pool ringed with
weeping willows, a log's fit floating-place.
Here to float, marking the weed creep
onward until all from bank to bank was
overfilmed, and there remained no clear
water of space for reflection of a single
star: to float, and feel the sodden fibres of
life loosening in slow decay&mdash;this was to be
the last state of the seedling which had
sprung up on the mountain slopes with
promise of mighty stem and overarching
branches full of sap like the cedars of the
Lord.</p>

<p>My life henceforth was to be ringed
round and overhung with so heavy an air
that joy and fancy should never fly in it,
but fall dead as the birds above Avernus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
according to the ancient story. I seemed
to see nothing upon the path of the future
but the stern form of Renunciation drawing
between me and the living world the
impassable circle of death in life, the <i>ultima
linea rerum</i>. It was the last decree, the irrevocable
sentence, the absolute end: and
I had not yet reached half the Psalmist's
span; I had not yet forgotten the lost
summer mornings when the breeze scented
with lilac came blowing through the casement,
bearing with it the sound of glad
voices welcoming the day.</p>

<p>Philosophers are prone to gird at the
animal in man, accusing it of dragging the
soul down to the mire in which it wallows.
They forget that by its brutal insistence
upon physical needs it often preserves from
madness, and timely arrests him who goes
like a sleep-walker upon the verge of the
abyss. Weariness and hunger are like brakes
upon the car; they stop the dire momentum
of grief, and insure that if misery will again
drive us furiously, she must lash winded
steeds anew. But what force should stay a
disembodied sorrow, which unbreathed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
period or alternation of despair, should be
rapt onward in the whirlwind and the hurricane,
gathering eternally a fresh impetus of
woe? Let us rail at the body for its weakness
if we will, but prize it also for its restraint
of the distracted mind. In the worst hour
of my dejection it was the body which
called the lost reason home. I became
hungry and ate, hardly knowing what I
did; I slept exhaustion away; and after
many hours awoke with clearer eyes, grateful
to the weak flesh, and ready in its company
to face life once more, a defeated but not
a desperate man. I was glad to be thus reminded
that the body could play this helpful
part, and my gratitude for its timely rescue
taught me in after days to endure its
tyranny with a better grace. In the interlude
between despair and new effort, I
once more turned a dispassionate gaze
upon myself, as upon some abandoned
slave of a drug; and maintaining an attitude
of half-amused detachment, sought
by a diagnosis of my case to establish the
real causes of my failure to lead a normal
life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>At the outset I would make it clear that
for me the only shyness that counts, is
that which is so deeply ingrained, as to
have outlasted youth. It may, indeed, be
physically related to that transient bashfulness
which haunts so many of us in our
younger days only to vanish at maturity,
swift as the belated ghost at cockcrow.
But unlike this common accident of growth,
it is no surface-defect, but an inward stain
which dyes the very fibres of the being.
It may, indeed, be somewhat bleached and
diminished by a timely and skilful treatment,
but is become too much a part of
life to be ever wholly washed away. And
the unhappy step-children of nature whose
inheritance it is, seldom find a deliverer
good at need; for as the world draws
no distinction between their grave affliction
and that other remediable misery of
youth, it will sanction no other treatment
than banter or mockery, which does but
infuse yet more deeply the mournful dye.
When this fails, it leaves its victims to the
desolation which according to its judgment
they have wilfully chosen; for the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
part ignoring their existence, but often
chastising them with scorpion-stings of
disdain. Yet the subjects of this scorn,
sufferers as I believe from a hereditary
tendency matured by neglect into disease,
deserve a more merciful usage than this,
and their plea for extenuating circumstances
should not be too impatiently rejected. For
in them what is to most men a transient
ailment has thrown down permanent roots
to draw a nourishment from pain: and he
who is fortunate enough to be whole
should think twice before he makes sport
of those in this distress.</p>

<p>To me this malady seems to arise from
an antinomy between the physical and intellectual
elements of the personality, from
an unhappy marriage of mind and body,
suffering the lower of the two partners to
abase the life of the higher by the long-drawn
misery of a hateful but indissoluble union.
When the physical and mental natures in
a man are happily attuned, there is a fair
concord in his life and the outward expression
of his being is an unimpeded process,
to which, as to the functions of a healthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
organism, no heedful thought is given. If
both natures are of the finest temper, they
find utterance in a noble amiability and ease
of manner; if both are coarse in the grain,
they blend in a na√Øve freedom always sure
of itself, the freedom of Sancho spreading
himself in the duchess's boudoir. Between
these two extremes there intervene a
hundred compromises by which minds and
bodies less equally yoked contrive to muffle
the discordant notes of an inharmonious
wedlock.</p>

<p>In most cases use gives to this politic
agreement the peace and permanence of
settled habit; the body proves itself so
far amenable that it is accepted as a needful
if uninspiring companion, and its plain
usefulness ends by dulling the edged criticisms
of the mind. But wherever there is
a permanent incompatibility too profound
for compromise, an elemental difference
keeping the personality continually distraught,
then shyness, in the sense in which
I understand it, assumes its inalienable
dominion. The flame of rebellion may
smoulder unobserved while the sufferer is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
in his own home, but among strangers it
will blaze fiercely, as the mind protests
against the misinterpretations of its unworthy
partner. This burning shame is
not the proof of a foolish conceit, as unsympathetic
criticism proclaims it, but the
visible misery of a keen spirit thwarted by
physical defect. The man who manifests
it is angered with himself because through
a physical hindrance he has failed to take
the place which would otherwise be his.
He is proud, it may be, but not fatuous; for
shyness as a rule implies a comparative
quickness and alertness of intellect: its
exceeding sensibility is exclusive of dulness;
and it is frequently due to the presence in
a reluctant body of a mind endowed with
active powers.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as diffidence appears where the
subtler formalities of life are compulsory,
it is clear that it essentially belongs to
the class called gentle, for this class alone
enforces that exacting code of etiquette to
which our discomfiture is so largely due.
Shyness has seldom place in the patriarchal
life where men live, "sound, without care,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
every man under his own vine or his own
fig-tree," nor among those who, perforce
pursuing a too laborious existence, have no
leisure for superficial refinements. Though
here and there you may find a Joseph Poorgrass,
it is rare among the simple; it is not
a popular weakness, and therefore wins no
popular sympathy. Such is its first social
limitation: it is almost restricted to the
classes which are outwardly refined.</p>

<p>But it has another limitation of equal
importance which may be described as
climatic; for this malady is not found in
equal degrees all over the habitable globe.
There are many lands where it hardly
exists at all even among the class which is
alone liable to it; and in its serious form it
is found only over a small part of the earth.
There are many causes which conduce to
this partial distribution. In one country
manners are not minutely schooled, women
being held of secondary account, and men
content without subtlety; in another, life
is in itself too primitive to devise the
artifices of refinement; in a third, the
fundamental disunion between the mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and the physical organism is prevented by
the kindly hand of nature. For these
reasons all the savage world, all the East,
and the whole of southern Europe have
little knowledge of the diffident, and what
zoologists would call the area of distribution
of the species is confined within narrow
geographical limits.</p>

<p>It is in fact chiefly in the north and west
of our own continent that the haunts of
the diffident are to be found, for there
alone are all the conditions necessary to
their maintenance fulfilled&mdash;a society sufficiently
leisured and wealthy to have elaborated
conventional rules of intercourse, the
assemblage of both sexes upon an equal
footing, and a climate which exaggerates
the antagonism between the quick mind
and the unresponsive body. Here the cold
humid airs have produced a race with great
limbs and great appetites, but compensated
these gifts by a certain unreadiness in the
delicate encounter of wits and graces. To
these impassive natures all displays of the
personality are distasteful, and the lighter
social arts, seeming both insignificant and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
histrionic, are learned with difficulty and
practised with repugnance. An awkwardness
of address, in the uneducated almost
bovine, becomes in the cultivated a painful
reserve and self-consciousness, reflecting in
open physical distress the uneasiness of the
man's whole being.</p>

<p>And among the northern nations which
are thus afflicted England has achieved
an undesirable supremacy, having herself
smoothed the path of her eminence by a
school system which withdraws her youth
from female influences during the years
when the tendency to reserve may be
combated with a certain hope of success.
It would ill become one who has never
recovered from the effects of such deprivation
to assume on the ground of his own
narrow experience any wide dissemination
of similar defects among his countrymen;
his testimony would be received with
suspicion, and he would be condemned
as one who to justify himself would drag
others down to his own poor level. Let
me therefore place myself on surer ground
by calling as a witness an impartial observer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
from another country, one exceptionally
trained in the analysis of national temperament
and conduct.</p>

<p>When M. Taine visited England towards
the close of the nineteenth century one of
the first things to attract his notice was
the bashfulness which he encountered in
unexpected places. He was surprised to
meet travelled and cultured men who were
habitually embarrassed in society, and so
reserved that you might live with them
six months before you discovered half their
excellent qualities. To unveil their true
nature there was needed the steady breeze
of a serious interest or the hurricane of
perilous times; the faint airs of courtliness
could not stir the heavy folds that hung
before their hearts. These strong men
could not join in delicate raillery, but
shrank back afraid; as if a tortoise, startled
by a shower of blossoms, should withdraw
into that thick carapace which can bear
the impact of a rock. There was one who
stammered pitifully in a drawing-room, but
the next day sought the suffrages of electors
with an unembarrassed and fluent eloquence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
so proving that his failure came not of folly
or cowardice, but from lack of training in
a certain school of fence. He needed the open
air for the play of his broadsword; and to his
hand, apt to another hilt, the foil appeared
a woman's weapon. Speaking of high aims
and national ideals, he moved in a large
place oblivious of himself; but in the
social arena he tripped with timid steps,
like a man essaying an unfamiliar dance.
On the platform he had the enthusiasm
and confidence of an orator; on the carpet
he could not string three sentences in any
courtly language.</p>

<p>In the North the art of mercurial
dialogue, which in the South is a natural
gift, is only learned under favourable conditions,
and is often condemned by those
who have it not, as a popinjay's accomplishment.
Immediate cordiality to
strangers is frowned upon as tending to
divorce courtesy from truth. It is otherwise
with the southern peoples. While
the Englishman conceals his benevolence by
a frigid aloofness of manner, or blurts out
friendliness like an indiscretion, the Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
is courtly without a second thought, and
the Frenchman seems the comrade of a
chance acquaintance from the moment
when he has taken his hand. They are
amiable without effort in the security of a
harmonious nature, and if they encounter
diffidence at all, observe it like an anthropologist
confronted with a survival of
primitive times in the culture of a civilized
age.</p>

<p>Taine did not err when he found
the home of shyness among the Teutonic
peoples; he saw that it flourishes in climatic
conditions acting hardly upon a vigorous
race, and only allowing it to cultivate ease
of manner by effort and outlay, just as they
only allow it to raise under glass the grapes
and oranges which more favoured peoples
can grow in the open air. He saw too
that this pain of diffidence becomes more
subtle as the progress of culture makes us
more sensitive to vague impressions from
our environment, and tunes the nerves to
a higher pitch. A shy nature upon this
plane of susceptibility suffers anguish from
an uncontrollable body; and even in peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>ful
moments the memory of the discomfitures
so inflicted may distort a man's
whole view of the world around him. He
is impatient of the wit which demands a
versatility in response beyond his powers,
and persuades himself into contempt of
those ephemeral arts to which his nature
cannot be constrained. Irritated at the
injustice which places so high in the general
scale of values accomplishments which he
cannot practise, shrinking from the suave
devices of gesture and expression which in
his own case might quickly pass into antic
or grimace, he withdraws more and more
from the places where such arts win esteem
to live in a private world of inner sentiment.
As he leaves this sure retreat but rarely
himself, so he forbids ingress to others; and
becoming yearly a greater recluse, he confines
himself more and more within the
walls of his forbidden city. The mind which
may have been fitted to expand in the free
play of intellectual debate or to explore the
high peaks of idea, loses its power of flight in
this cave where it dwells with a company
of sad thoughts, until at last the sacrifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
is complete and the perfect eremite is
formed.</p>

<p>But the virile Teutonic spirit does not
suffer things to reach this ultimate pass
without stubborn resistance, and this is
one reason why shyness is often so conspicuous,
seeming deliberately to court an
avoidable confusion. Over and over again
it forces the recalcitrant body back into
the arena, preferring repeated humiliation
to a pusillanimous surrender. People often
wonder at the recklessness with which
the shy expose themselves to disaster, forgetting
that in this insistence of a soul
under discomfiture, there is evidence of a
moral strength which is its own reward.
What discipline is harder than that which
conscientious diffidence imposes upon itself?
To stand forth and endure, though every
instinct implores retreat, is a true assertion of
the higher self for the satisfaction of imperious
duty. Such deliberate return towards
suffering is no cowardice, but a triumph over
weak flesh; and the awkward strife of diffidence
may often prove a greater feat of arms
than the supple fence of self-possession.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Like the physical obstacles, the mists,
the snows and bleak winds, which have
hardened the fibre of northern men, diffidence
as an obstacle to ease has its place
among the causes of strong character; and
those who appear at a first glance weak and
ineffectual as Hamlet, will often in the
light of knowledge be found guided by the
most inflexible moral determination. They
see, as in a mirage, peace supreme and
adorable, but may not tread the hermit's
path that leads to her dwelling. Only a
religious vow might justify the abandonment
of the human struggle, and even that
appears desertion. The stern genius of the
North grudges immurement, even to great
piety, remembering that Christ himself
remained but forty days in the desert and
then returned to deliver the world. If he
had remained there all his life, and never
met the Pharisees and high-priests, our forefathers
would have rejected his law. For
this reason there can be no more rest for
the shy than for starving Tantalus; for
this reason my flight into the East had
been foredoomed to failure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>If shyness is thus affected by climate and
geography, its birth and growth are also
conditioned by historical causes. Just as
it is the peculiar failing of northern and
western peoples, so it is the creation of
comparatively modern times; it had no
place among the classified weaknesses of
men until these peoples began in their
turn to make history.</p>

<p>In Greece, where limb and thought were
consentient in one grace of motion, the
body was too perfect an expression of the
mind to admit any consciousness of discord;
the greater simplicity of a life passed largely
in the open air, left no place for awkwardness
in the franker converse of man with
man. Moreover the seclusion of women
rendered unnecessary that complicated code
of manners which the freer intercourse of
the sexes has built up in later times as a
barrier against brutality or the unseemly
selfishness of passion. In Greece the words
of the witty and the wise could be heard
in the market-place; good conversation
was not for the few alone; and the common
man might of unquestioned right approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the circle of Socrates or Plato. The sense
of community was everywhere, overthrowing
reserve, and propitious to the universal
growth of fellowship.</p>

<p>In the Roman world things were changed;
there were more closed doors and courts
impenetrable of access. Insignia of office,
gradations of wealth and rank, sundered
those of high estate from classes which now
acknowledged their own inferiority; privacies,
exclusions, distinctions innumerable,
altered the face of public life as the easy
<i>mos majorum</i> was confined by the ordinances
of encroaching fashion. It was now that
women began to be cast for leading parts
upon the great stage of life. Under the
Empire, by the rapid removal of her disabilities
the Roman matron achieved a
position of independence which made her,
according to her nature, a potent force of
good or evil. It was now that the intricate
threads of social prescription were woven
into that ceremonial mantle which was
afterwards to sit so uneasily on the shoulders
of barbarian men.</p>

<p>But the time for shyness was not yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
come, for Italy is a sunny land where clear
air makes clear minds, blandly or keenly
observant of the world, and never impelled
by onset of outer mists and darkness to tend
a flickering light within themselves. There
was melancholy, high and stately, such as
Lucretius knew, when he went lonely among
the homesteads or along the shore; but it
was too exalted to be one with diffidence,
for he who will hold the sum of things in
his thoughts walks on clouds above the
heads of men, free of all misgiving. Perhaps
beyond the Alps, in some Rh√¶tian upland
where Roman dignity was interfused with
old barbaric roughness, the first signs of our
malady were perceived and the first ancestor
of all the shy was born. But even yet the
time was not ripe, nor the place prepared.
Christianity had to come, turning men's
eyes inwards and proclaiming the error of
the objective pagan way. A new feeling,
the sense of personal unworthiness before
God, spreading through the Roman world,
now stirred mankind to still communing
with themselves, and sanctioned the stealing
away from the noisy festivals of life. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
enjoining a search into the depths of the
heart, it encouraged the growth of a self-consciousness
hitherto unknown. It was
not always a panic of contrition, sweeping
the joyous out of the sunlight into a monastic
shade, which brought the troubled into a
new way of peace, but sometimes a quiet
joy in renunciation, congruous with a timid
mood, leading by gradual allurement to
cloisters of shadowy lanes and cells which
were forest bowers. The new faith gave
open sanction to evasion of the banquet,
and thus fortified and increased those who
loved not the ceremonial day. The spirit
of solitude, no more a m√¶nad, but a nun,
sheltered earth's children in the folds of
her robe, and no man said her nay.</p>

<p>Moreover, Christianity quickened the force
of that feminine influence which Rome had
first set flowing through the civilized world,
but diverted the stream from irregular and
torrential courses into a smooth channel
gliding amid sacred groves. It clothed
woman with ideal grace and virtue, and
perceived in her powers which the virile
mind could never wield. "Inesse quin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>etiam
sanctum aliquid et providum putant,
nec aut consilia earum aspernantur, nec
responsa negligunt." So our ancestors held
in the northern woods, and Christianity,
purifying and expanding their belief, fulfilled
it with a new perfection.</p>

<p>But this gradual binding of all men's
limbs in silken cords of reverence, making
a rude world civil, was now to inaugurate
for diffidence its miserable career. Through
the rough deference of the German camp,
through the Proven√ßal code of <i>courtoisie</i>,
up to the modern law of fine manners, the
drudge and chattel of the primeval tribe
has risen to impose her law upon the modern
world. Earth is better for this finer power,
but social intercourse is less sincere. For
woman, having curbed the brute man by
conventional restraints of outward demeanour,
has made human intercourse smooth
and seemly, but imposed upon mankind the
wearing of unnatural masks. Before the
multitude of locked souls with labels of
smiling faces the sensitive nature feels itself
mocked, and is soon distraught. It cannot
suffer convention gladly for an ultimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
good, but is chilled by this everlasting
urbanity, which must, it fancies, be compact
of irony and conceal a disingenuous
soul.</p>

<p>All this finished science of illusion is like
an east wind to the confidences of the shy,
and if they stay within its range they are
blighted before their hearts have time to
unfold. They long for a less biting air, for
vernal hours in sheltered dells, where without
sheaths and unguarded the hearts of
flowers lie open to their neighbours and to
heaven. There was once a simple day when
religion set hearts interflowing, but now it
can melt them only within the precincts;
the fire which is carried from the altar is
dead at the church door. The brotherliness
of those early days is indeed often found in
humble walks of life, but these we cannot
continually tread, because our intellectual
and artistic tastes find there no sufficient
nurture. Among the cultured a cold convention
often reigns, behind which only a
more persistent nature than ours can pass.
Unless, therefore, we find our way into some
circle of gentle scholars or lovers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
beautiful quite simple in their tastes, a
thing possible but not often granted by
a niggard fortune, we are perforce thrown
back upon our own company, and move
towards the grave alone. For this we
accuse none; nothing is more at fault than
our own constitution. But to us society is
a school of dames, who are not to be blamed
if amid the crowd that clamours for their
teaching, they find no time for the backward
scholar. We are the dunces of the school,
and are dismissed without learning the
accomplishments set forth upon the prospectus.
That is why in our northern streets
so many seeming hats are cowls.</p>

<p>In England the loss of congenial intercourse
is perhaps more certain than in other
lands. For through his national reserve the
highly-cultured Englishman has a cold perfection
of good breeding to which heartiness
is vulgarity; he emanates intimidation, and
in courtesy is rather studious than spontaneous,
seldom genial but in an ancient
friendship. If you knew him to the concealed
heart, and were suffered to assay the
fine metal beneath this polished surface, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
would win a golden friendship; but only
on a desert island would he permit the
operation. To the shy who may encumber
his path his bearing seems marked by an
indifference which they magnify into aversion,
and are thereby the worse confounded.
In a land where such convention reigns
they go through life like persons afflicted
with a partial deafness; between them and
the happier world there is as it were a
crystalline wall which the pleasant low
voices of confidence can never traverse.</p>

<p>I say, then, that the real, the enduring
shyness is that inveteration of reserve to
which a few men in a few countries are
miserably condemned. Others know it as
a transient inconvenience, as the croup or
measles of childhood; but in us it is obstinate
and ineradicable as grave disease. If
out of the long frustration of our efforts to
be whole some strain of bitterness passes
into our nature; if sometimes we burn with
unjust resentment against the fate which,
suffers such lives as ours to be prolonged,
let it be remembered in extenuation that to
those who bear a double burden human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
charity owes the larger kindliness. For
though like you we bear our share of common
troubles, O happier men and women,
the common pleasures and compensations
which are as wings upon your shoulders are
heavy packs on ours. The cheerful contrasts
are for you alone; for us the bright threads
interwoven in the dark stuff of life were
faded before they reached the loom.</p>

<p>You who have the friendships and affections
without which you would not care
to live a day, think more kindly of those
to whom the interludes of toil are often
harder than the toil itself. Of your charity
believe our fate ordained and not the
choice of our own perversity; for what man
born of woman would choose a path so sad,
were there not within him some guiding
and possessing devil which he could in
nowise cast out? Never will in maddest
hours of freedom consented to such doom;
we were condemned at birth, our threads
were spoiled upon the fingers of the Norns.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Such in its broader outlines seemed the
infirmity which had grown with my growth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and now had to be reckoned with, like the
bridle of Theages, as a permanent hindrance
to a reasonable happiness. Old hopes lay
shattered about me&mdash;well, I had to pick
up the fragments and piece together a less
ambitious ideal.</p>

<p>I will not linger over the forces which
helped my resolution, the great and general
remedies which come to the relief of men
in like evil case. Religion, philosophy, art,
science, literature&mdash;all promised their anodynes
against despair; slowly they stirred
in me anew those springs of interest in life
which disillusion seemed to have choked for
ever. I rose up, and looking round upon
the world saw that it was still good; and
there came into my memory brave words
which a golden book puts in the mouths of
its indomitable knights: "I will take the
adventure which God shall ordain me." I
now perceived that if evil fortune had
unhorsed me it had yet left me endurance
to continue the combat on foot. My
second failure was more final and disastrous
than the first discomfiture in earlier life,
but now the plague of pessimism was stayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
by a greater recuperative power. Those
long hours of the long eastern day, spent
under the verandah with books of many
ages and languages, had not been altogether
fruitless; they had helped to mature a
wider and more catholic taste than that
of restless youth, the kind of culture that
brings not rebellion but peace.</p>

<p>In my eastern watch-tower I had re-read
the great books from a new point of vantage,
and let the eye roam over fields of literature
which lie beyond the undergraduate's
bounds; by a still permeation of fine influence,
my crude philosophy was unconsciously
mellowed, as the surface of ivory,
according to Roman belief, by the bland
air of Tibur. For by the mere being in
an atmosphere of serenity our nature grows
porous to gracious influences streaming in
we know not how or when, and taking their
abode in our very grain and structure. And
so without consciousness of good desert, I
found myself confident in a new discipline,
and looking for the word of command from
wiser leaders than Byron or the youthful
Shelley. Queen Mab was now the saddest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
rhetoric, and Childe Harold's plaint unseemly
lamentation; I had erased from my calendar
of saints the names of apostles of affliction
once held in honour; the Caliph Amurath
with his tale of fourteen happy days out of
a long life of royal opportunity; Swift
with his birthday lection from Jeremiah.
Rather there trooped into memory with a
quiet pomp and induction of joy, forms of
men who, though justified in rebellion by
every human suffrage, remained loyal to
the end and proved by endurance a more
imperial humanity. Socrates unperturbed
by mortal injustice; Dante a deep harmonious
voice amid jangling destinies;
William the Silent serene in every desperate
conjecture&mdash;these seemed now the more
perfect captains. If exile had done no
more than transfer my allegiance to such
as these, I had not borne the lash in
vain.</p>

<p>But at the first setting out upon this
later stage I had still mistakes to make,
and the ascent to tranquillity was not to be
accomplished without stumbling. It was
the old Roman creed which first drew me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
away from fretting memories; in its high
restraint, as of a hushed yet mighty wind,
it breathed a power of valiant endurance,
and promised before nightfall the respite of
a twilight hour. For stoicism has qualities
which seem foreordained for the bracing of
shy souls, as if the men who framed its
austere laws had prescience of our frailty and
consciously legislated to its intention. It
is the philosophy of the individual standing
by himself, as the shy must always stand,
over against a world which he likes not
but may not altogether shun. And in
this proud estrangement it promises release
from all the inquisition of morbid fears,
and an imperturbable calm above the need
of earthly friends or comfort or happiness;
it plants the feet upon that path of nature
along which a man may go strongly, consoled
in solitude by a god-like sense of self-reliance.
This immutable confidence is the
essential power of stoicism, which does not,
like the great oriental religions, tame personality
by ruthless maiming, but teaches it
to bear the brunt of adversities erect, like
an athlete finely trained. Its very arrogance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
its sufficiency, perforce commend it to those
whose instinct urges to self-abasement: its
lofty disregard of adverse circumstance is
medical to their timidity.</p>

<p>And so in the hour of my bereavement
its voice inspired to resistance like a bugle
sounding the advance; its echoes rang with
the assurance that man was not made to be
the worm of Eden, darkly creeping in the
dust, but rather its noblest creature, with
the light crowning his head and the winds
tossing his hair. And then its strong simplicity,
so masculine and unemotional, was
grateful to one now finally dismated, and
so cruelly handled as to have, it seemed,
no use for a heart any more. Better let
feeling die than be betrayed by diffidence
into the denial of its true allegiance, or into
expressions of the inner life false and wry
as the strange laughter which the doomed
suitors in Ithaca could not control. Though
it stifled feeling, the creed of Cleanthes
exalted the intellect, which was all that
now remained to me unimpaired; surely
it was the appointed rule for one henceforth
to be severed from the passions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
enthusiasms through which humanity errs
and is happy.</p>

<p>"The world," the wise Stoic seemed to
say, "is twofold in its nature. Some things
may be changed by man, others are by his
utmost effort immutable. God has implanted
in you a right reason by which,
when it is well trained, you can infallibly
distinguish between the two, avoiding
thus all unworthy fretfulness and all idle
kicking against the pricks. Therefore he
has made you for happiness; for the joy
of men is an achievement; and their misery
in the coveting of the unattainable end. If
you would fulfil his benevolent design, seek
only what has been placed in your power,
frankly resigning all that lies beyond; but
be ever difficult in renunciation; test and
sound well every issue, lest you leave a
permitted good undone, than which nothing
is a greater sin. To be loyal, to be contented,
to acquiesce in all things save only
in ameliorable evil, this is to live according
to nature, which is God's administration.
If you are assiduous in careful choosing, you
will learn at last to make a right use of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
event; you will be harassed no more by
vain desire or unreasoning aversion, but will
become God's coadjutor and be always of
his mind. So, when external things have
ceased to trouble your spirit, you will no
longer be a competitor for vanities; but,
enfranchised from all solicitude, you will
have discarded envy and conceit and intolerance,
which are the ill fruits of that vain
rivalry. You will neither cringe before
power nor covet great place, for alike from
inordinate affection and from the fear of
pain or death you will be free. Disenamoured
of mundane things, you will live
simply and unperturbed, in kindness and
cheerfulness and in gratitude to Providence.
Life will be to you as a feast or solemnity,
and when it comes to a close, you will rise
up saying, 'I have been well and nobly
entertained, it is fit that I give place to
another guest.'"</p>

<p>The strength and mastery thus promised
raised my dejected spirits, as the words of
a new and sanguine physician may hearten
one who had long lain stricken yet now
dares to hope for the day of recovery. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
was a law which did not denounce the world
as illusion or enjoin a cloistral seclusion upon
the mind, but rather proposed each and
every appearance as a touchstone on which
the quality of personality should be unceasingly
tried. By the constant application
of a high standard to life, it seemed to
implant an incorrupt seed of manliness, and
to create in its disciples that saner mood
which holds in equal aversion a Heliogabalus
and a Simeon Stylites. So persuaded, I
could join with the fervour of a neophyte
in the Stoic's profession: "Good and evil
are in choice alone, and there is no cause of
sorrowing save in my own errant and wilful
desires. When these shall have been overcome,
I shall possess my soul in tranquillity,
vexing myself in nowise if, in the world's
illusive good, all men have the advantage
over me. For all outward things I will bear
with equal mind, even chains or insults or
great pain, ashamed of this only, if reason
shall not wholly free me from the servitude
of care. Let others boast of material goods;
mine is the privilege of not needing these
or stooping to their control. I will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
but a temperate desire of things open to
choice, as they are good and present, and
the tempter shall find no hold for his hands
by which to draw me astray. I will be
content with any sojourn or any company,
for there is none, howsoever perilous, which
may not prove and strengthen the defences
of my soul. For I have built an impregnable
citadel whence, if only I am true to
myself, I can repel assaults from the four
quarters of heaven. Who shall console one
lifted above the range of grief, whom
neither privation nor insolence can annoy?
for he has peace as an inalienable possession,
and by no earthly tyranny shall be perturbed.
Bearing serenely all natural impediments
to action, trespassing beyond no
eternal landmark, by no foolishness provoked,
he shall become a spectator and
interpreter of God's works; he shall ripen
to the harvest in the sunshine and wait
tranquilly for the sickle, knowing that corn
is only sown that it may be reaped, and
man only born to die."</p>

<p>The mere repetition of these words, so
instinct with the spirit of old Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
fortitude, roused me to a more immediate
resolution than any other form of solace.
There are times when a splendour of exaggeration
is the best foil to truth. The
Roman's pride is the best corrective to the
earthward bias of the diffident; by its
excess of an opposite defect it drives us
soonest into the mean of a simple and
manly confidence. It is better for us first
to repeat, "Dare to look up to God and
say: Make use of me for the future as
Thou wilt, I am of the same mind, I am
equal with Thee.... Lead me whither
Thou wilt," than to dwell upon such words
as these: "It is altogether necessary that
thou have a true contempt for thyself if
thou desire to prevail against flesh and
blood"&mdash;or these: "If I abase myself ...
and grind myself to the dust which I am,
Thy grace will be favourable to me, and
Thy light near unto my head.... By
seeking Thee alone and purely loving Thee
I have found both myself and Thee, and
by that love have more deeply reduced
myself to nothing."</p>

<p>This supreme abnegation may leave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
saint unharmed, but it is ill fitted for those
who droop already with the malady of
dejection. The divine wisdom which knows
the secrets of all hearts and their necessities
infinitely various, shall exact obedience
according to no adamantine law: it loves
not the jots and tittles of formalism, nor
the pretensions of those who would cast all
things in one mould. From those made perfect,
from the saints whose links with earth
are almost severed, whose sight begins to
pierce gross matter through, it may accept
prostration and endless contrite tears, knowing
that to these, upon the very verge of
illumination, the forms of slavery have lost
their vileness. But to those who are still
of earth and can but conceive God's fatherhood
according to earthly similitudes, it
will not ordain a prone obeisance. Such
it will require to stand erect even in contrition,
in that posture which is the privilege
of sons. We who are unperfected affront
God supposing him pleased with the prostration
of his children. It is the ignorance
of a feudal age that ascribes to him a
Byzantine love of adulation; but that age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
is no more, and he disserves the divine
majesty who imputes to it a liking for the
<i>esprit d'antichambre</i>.</p>

<p>I did not need to dwell upon my weakness
and misery but rather upon the grandeur of
humanity, whose kinship and collaboration
God himself does not reject. The Stoic
phase was a useful stage on the road of
convalescence, and the majestic words of
Epictetus more helpful to a manlier bearing
than the confessions of the saintliest souls.
If, as is not to be doubted, there are others
who seek an issue from the same dark region
where I wandered, I do not fear to point
them to the Stoic way, which like a narrow
gorge cold with perpetual shadow is yet
their shortest path upward to the high
slopes lit with sunlight. Let them enter
it without fear and endure its shadows a
while, for by other ways they will fetch a
longer compass and come later to their
release.</p>

<p>But when some interval had passed I
became aware that this cold ideal was not
the end, and that out of the gall of austerity
sweetness should yet come forth. Wise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
men have said that all great systems of
ethics meet upon a higher plane, as the
branches of forest trees rustle together in
the breeze; for though in the dark earth
their roots creep apart, their summits are
joined in the freedom of clear air. As I
now struck inland from the iron shores of
shipwreck, my heart warmed to a brighter
and softer landscape, and with Landor I
began to wish that I might walk with
Epicurus on the right hand and Epictetus
on the left. With a later thinker I reflected
that if the Stoic knew more of the faith
and hope of Christianity, the Epicurean
came nearer to its charity. For it is true
that Stoicism commands admiration rather
than love. It was indeed too harsh a saying
that "the ruggedness of the Stoic is only
a silly affectation of being a god, to wind
himself up by pulleys to an insensibility
of suffering": that is the judgment of the
bluff partisan, so shocked by the adversary's
opinions that he feels absolved from any
effort to understand them. But even those
who in extremity have been roused to new
valour by the precepts as by a Tyrt√¶an ode,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
for all the gratitude which they owe, will
not impute to their deliverers an inhuman
perfection. The Stoic does in truth wear
a semblance of academic conceit, as though
related to God not as a child to its father,
but as a junior to a senior colleague. And
with all its sufficiency, his philosophy seems
too Fabian in its counsels; it is always
withdrawing, passing by on the other side,
avoiding battle&mdash;so that as a preparation
for the uttermost ordeal it will often prove
inferior to the reckless pugnacity of a narrow
zealot.</p>

<p>Then, too, it acts like a frost not merely
upon personal, but upon national ambition,
and so keeps the wellspring from the root.
Its assumption of a superhuman fortitude
accords but ill with scientific truth, for if
with one bound every man may become as
God, he will despise that infinitely slow
upward progression which is the only real
advance. But, above all, it lives estranged
from tenderness, in which alone at certain
hours of torment the distracted mind finds
God's face reflected. It preaches renunciation
of all vain aversions and desires; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
it repels sweet impulses that are not vain.
By exalting apathy in regard to personal
suffering, it becomes insensible to others'
pain also. In the conviction that appeals
for sympathy are avowals of unworthiness,
it will have no part in the love of comrades,
and it never discovered the truth that the
strength and the compassion of the Divine
are one perfection.</p>

<p>There is a favourite medi√¶val legend
depicted in one of the windows of the
cathedral at Bourges, which exposes in a
characteristic fashion this weakness of the
Stoic's creed. The Evangelist St John,
when at Ephesus, remarked in the forum
the philosopher Cratinus giving a lesson of
abnegation to certain rich young men. At
the teacher's bidding the youths had converted
all their wealth into precious stones,
and these they were now bidden crush to
dust with a heavy hammer in the presence
of the assembled people, that so they might
make public profession of their contempt
for riches. But St John was angered at so
wasteful a renunciation. "It is written,"
he said, "that whoso would be perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
should not destroy his possessions, but sell
them, and give the proceeds to the poor."
"If your master is the true God," replied
Cratinus scornfully, "restore these gems
again to their original form, and then they
shall be bestowed according to your desire."
St John prayed, and the precious stones
lay there once more perfect in all their
brilliance and splendour. The moral of
the old tale is clear&mdash;that all virtue without
charity is nothing worth; and that of
virtue without charity, the Stoic's cold renunciation
is the chief type and ensample.</p>

<p>The insight into this higher truth did
not come by inspiration, but was gradually
imparted during long summer days, when
I wandered from dawn to dark among the
fields and woods. Hoping at first no more
than to tire the mind with the body and
so win a whole repose, I became by degrees
receptive of a new learning from nature,
which created new sympathies and kindled
fresh ambitions. Naturally I again read
Wordsworth, and now for the first time
since childhood I knew what joys intimacy
brings. I was one of a brotherhood, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
wherever I went was sure of a friendly
salutation. Things that grew in silence
became my friends; I was with them at
all hours, in light and shadow, in warmth
and cold, watching their gracious and
responsive existences, which reject no good
gift, but radiantly grow towards the light
while it endures. Insensibly the spirit of
this gentle expansive life was infused within
me, until the heart which I had deemed
useless and outworn, began to open like a
flower scathed by frost, at the full coming
of spring. The plants and trees were
human to me, the brooks spoke with articulate
voice; by that ancient witchery of
animism, old as the relationship of man
and nature, I was put to school again:
until at last, absorbed in the vicissitudes of
small things and surrendering reason to a host
of pathetic fallacies, I was taught the great
secret that life may not be centred in itself,
but in the going out of the heart is wisdom.
And as among human friends there are
some to whom a man is bound by deeper
and tenderer links than to the rest, so it
is with these other friends which have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
language, but only the wild-wood power of
growing about the heart. Among their
gracious company each man will discover
his own affinity, and having found it will
look on the rest of nature with brighter
eyes. Some learn the great lessons from
mountains, lakes, and sounding cataracts;
others from broad rivers peacefully flowing
to the sea. To me there spoke no such
romantic voices. My wanderings led me
through a country of simple rural charm,
and the friends that became dearest to me
were just our English elms.</p>

<p>Who but the solitary, artists alone excepted,
understand the full charm of elms in
an English landscape? To us there is an
especial appeal in their loneliness, as they
range apart along the hedgerows, embayed
in blue air and sunlight which do but play
upon the fringe of your huddling forest.
See them on a breezy August morning
across a tawny corn-field, printing their
dark feathery contours on a blue sky and
holding the shadows to their bosoms; or
on a June evening get them between you and
the setting sun, and mark the droop and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
poise of the upper foliage fretted black
upon a ground of red fire. Here are no
cones or hemispheres, or shapeless bulks of
green, but living beings of articulated form,
clothed in verdure as with the fine-wrought
drapery that enhances rather than conceals
the beauty of the statue.</p>

<p>Or at a still later hour, over against the
harvest moon, see them rise congruous with
the gentle night, casting round them not
palls of ominous gloom, but clear translucent
shadows sifted through traceries of
leafage which do but veil the light. And
what variety of form and structure sunders
them from other trees, what irregular persuasive
grace. Some are tall and straight,
springing like fountains arrested in the
moment when they turn to fall; others
bend oblique without one perpendicular
line, every branch by some subtle instinct
evading the hard angles of earth-measurement
as unmeet for that which frames the
sky; others again spread to all the quarters
of heaven their vast umbrageous arms. No
trees are so companionable as the elms
to the red-roofed homestead which nestles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
at their feet and is glad for them. Seen
from a distance, how delightful is this
association, how delicate the contrast of
tile and leaf and timbered barn, each lending
some complement to the other's fairest
imperfection. Perhaps there will be a whole
line of distinct trees, and then you will see
as it were a cliff-side of verdure in which,
beneath the billowy curves of lit foliage,
there open caverns and cool deeps of shadow
fit for a Dryad's rest.</p>

<p>To know the elm-tree you must not come
too near, for it too is wild and does not
reveal its nature lightly; you may be cooler
in the shadow of the beech or stand drier
beneath the red-stemmed leaves of the
sycamore. Yet it suffers the clinging ivy;
it was beloved of poets in old days, and
painters love it still. It has not the walnut's
vivid green nor the rare flush that lights up
the pine-stem. Its leaves are rough and
of no brilliance; its bark is rugged also.
But in life the familiar guardian of home
meadows, it has stood by our fathers' landmarks
from generation to generation, and
when fallen and hewn and stacked it sheds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
a fragrance which, wherever perceived in
after years, brings back memories of
wanderings in deep lanes and of the great
dim barns where we played in childhood.
In the dull winter days when only yews
and cypresses wear their leaves, I sometimes
wander to a place whose walls are hung
with the works of many a seer and lover of
elms; there seated before a few small frames
I give them thanks for having read the dear
trees truly, and glorified a close and barren
gallery with all the breezes and colours of
the fields: I am beyond all noise and murkiness,
walking in the peace and spaciousness
of unsullied air.</p>

<p>To a mind now happily reverted to the
primitive confidence in souls everywhere indwelling
and creating sympathies between
all things, the bonds of kinship between
man and nature were drawn ever closer,
and it seemed a wholly natural belief that
the changes of the visible universe, affecting
things which lived an almost personal existence,
should be instinct with the deeper
meaning of events in the drama of human
existence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Like the every-day life of men with its
imperceptible attritions was the insensible
growth and decay of things; as the tumult
of his emotions were the storms and catastrophes
that convulse the face of nature.
The movement never ceased; the transforming
power was never wearied; the
spectator had but to give rapt attention,
to be carried beyond his poor solicitudes
to a participation in elemental processes of
change in which the fates of humanity were
mysteriously involved. The thought of this
indissoluble union kept alive the sense of
brotherhood within me, of responsibility in
life, of interest in all that happens; and
whether it was the daily contraction of a
pond in drought, or a battle of ants by the
wayside, or the first tinge of autumn upon
the woods, all was ennobled by symbolic
relationships to man's experience, which in
the unceasing flow of their perception were
lustral to a solitary heart, without them
choked and stagnant.</p>

<p>There was a certain heath-clad ridge
which like a watch-tower set above a city
never failed to bring before the ranging eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
some vision pregnant of those emotions by
which the sense of humanity is quickened
to a deeper consciousness of itself. The
witchery of space was there always, and
seemed to draw from the soul the clinging
mists of her indifference. It was there that
I saw nature in all her moods, and felt that
to each my own moods responded; there
that despondency, imagining her monotony
of woe, was confuted by the saving changefulness
of created things. I remember one
day, when a summer storm was spending
its fury, I stood upon this ridge and looked
across the low lands that stretched away
beneath me. They lay with all their
boundaries confused by a pall of purple
gloom, then darkly transparent, and dissolving
before the returning sun, whose
penetrative influence was felt rather than
actually perceived. As I gazed, high in the
veil of cloud there began faintly to gleam a
spot of palest gold, so high that it seemed
to belong to the sky and to have no part
in an earthly landscape. Gradually it expanded,
grew more vivid, and assumed form,
other forms and tints emerged beside it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
until at last it was revealed as a ripe corn-field
on the high slopes across the valley,
and before many moments had passed, a
long line of downs stood out in the pure air
with a sculptural clearness, as if during the
storm all had been uprooted and moved
a whole league towards the spot where I
stood. While the rainbow spanned the
plain, and the thunder still rolled in the
distance, all the opposite heaven cleared
almost to the furthest horizon; but there
a remoter range yet lay half-covered by a
billowy mass of clouds, like the hull of a
dismasted ship in the folds of her fallen
sails. At last even this trace of the battle
was gone; the sun shone unopposed; the
wet lands and clear sky were lit with an
intenser brightness for their transient eclipse.</p>

<p>Then the humanity of all these things
was borne in upon my mind, and I was
affected by these vicissitudes shadowing
forth the destiny of man, and reminding
him in their beautiful and majestic procession
that nature endures no perpetual
gloom. The sudden ruin of a bright day
in deluge and darkness and sonorous thunder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the timid reappearance of faint light, the
natural forms strangely emerging from the
perplexed wrack infesting the heaven, and
at last seen as never before through leagues
of pellucid air; the thunder's silence, the
final and supreme triumph of light;&mdash;these
swift yet utter revolutions of the visible
world, by very grace of mutability, were
rich with instant consolations for the soul's
misgiving. They served to remind me that
the fears, the spiritual conflicts, the darkness
that seems eternal, are mere incidents of a
summer noon and leave behind them a
purer and serener day. Through all this
close intercourse with nature my mind was
being prepared for a healthier relation to
my fellow-man, and my heart saved from
the petrification of melancholy self-regard.
The ever-growing delight in these inanimate
things, the constant discovery of new
charms as knowledge widened with experience,
united to prevent stagnation and
despair; they kept heart and mind alert
for the perception of new glories; and it
is from a clear sense of their salutary
power that I dwell upon them in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
record of a self-tormented life. How should
he find life colourless whose eyes are often
fixed upon the sky, who sees grey zones of
cloud flush crimson before the sunrise, and
at evening the wide air richly glowing,
moted as with the bloom of plums and the
golden pollen of all flowers?</p>

<p>At the end of that summer I returned to
the occupations of life, appeased and almost
happy in this inheritance of new sympathies.
And before long I found that these were
themselves but precursors of that which
was to come, and that like the paranymphs
who escort the bride, they did but apparel
the heart for a deeper and more abiding joy.
They were busied about me in tranquil
hours, and speaking not, but seeming to
wait in gladness for another, they made me
serenely expectant also. They destroyed all
sadness of retrospect; they led me always
forward; with faces transparent with the
light of an inward happiness they seemed
to promise a vision at each near bending
of the way. From glad looks and gestures
assuring imminent joy, I too was charmed
into a like faith, and went on blithely in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the confidence of a coming illumination.
Nor was that hope vain, for at length the
mystery was made plain, and one day they
brought me exulting into the presence of
the Ideal Love.</p>

<p>There is a place in every heart which
must be filled by adoration, or else the
whole will grow hard and wither like a
garden whose central fountain is grown
dry. And though the affection of mortal
man or woman may abandon it, there
remains yet this other love which by pure
and strenuous invocation may be drawn to
it, and dwell in it, to the ennoblement of
life; so great is the care of providence for
mortal need. Love is our need, and it is
given, if we despair not of it, even to such
as have rarely felt the glow of earthly
passion. For love is of many kinds; yet
the palest and most subtle of its forms are
made real to those who believe, and may
become the guiding influences of their lives.
Such are the visions of the ideal love to
which those glad natural sympathies now
led me, leaving me alone awhile that I
might worship the orient light. And when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
I came out from that presence I rejoiced
indeed, for the path was clear for my return,
and life was now glad with promise like an
orchard burgeoning with white blossoms.
Old memories crowded back on me of hours
beneath the cedars with the Ph√¶drus and
the Vita Nuova, hours made happy with
intellectual and austere delights. But
now the joy was other than intellectual,
though significant tenfold, for then in untried
youth I had wondered at the beauty of an
imaginary world; now with eyes that had
looked on desolation I perceived that these
visions were true. For had they been no
more than airy fancies, they surely had
not endured throughout these long ages in
our laden and mortal air.</p>

<p>It was not merely the beauty of a literary
setting which had preserved them: the
craftsman's skill might indeed have enhanced
their natural splendour, but it
could not have alone inspired them with
this perennial life. The gem with fire in
its heart outlives the delicate setting;
though it may be maltreated and buried
for centuries by the wayside, it will come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to light when the gold that framed it is
long battered or lost, and will be desired
by new generations for its inherent and
unalterable beauty.</p>

<p>Not Plato's or Dante's creative power,
but truth surviving all incarnations of
genius, has kept this celestial gem aglow:
they have but celebrated that which was
never mortal, and guided wandering eyes to
heaven's most beautiful star. This intangible
and unincarnate vision exacts more
from its votaries than the love which
walks the earth: holding the lover ever in
the strain of apprehension, it inures him to
unwearying worship, and itself moving in
regions incorruptible, never loses the glory
of its first hour. The years may pass, but
one face, like a hallowed thing, abides
continually; years may fret and corrode
other ideals, but to this they add beauties
of ever fresh significance. The auroral glow
is always round it, brightening the world,
until it becomes an emblem of illumination
and the symbol of eternal truths.
This visionary presence wakes aspiration to
new effort and touches the intellect with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
passion; beleaguered thought sallies out
with new strength, and the frontiers of
darkness recede before it. From this comes
the quickening of the heart without which
hope wanes and the mind is barren: the
deep pure joy of contemplation awakens all
that is best in the soul, which goes towards
it on tense wings of desire. And as with
time it draws further from the earth, and,
following, the soul essays ever higher flights,
it is often poised at a great height as in a
trance of motion, whence it looks back
upon the world it has left, and round it
upon other worlds. Then, its love-range
being wondrously expanded, it sees beyond
that visionary countenance, which dissolves
and forms again like a delicate wreath of
mist; and clear starlight falls upon it from
every side, so that all shadow is destroyed.
And when it returns to earth again, and is
forced to contemplate meaner things, it is
now aware that the very soil is compacted
of dust of stars, and that he who looks listlessly
upon creation is unworthy of the
human name. And so continually flying
forth and returning, it weaves endless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
bonds between the infinitesimal and the
infinite, forgetting how to despise, which
is the heavenly science.</p>

<p>All this ardour is awakened and sustained
by love, which began in sense and is
now transformed. Through each succeeding
change it is known for the same divine
power which has so attuned the body
that it vibrates no more to desire alone,
but is now become resonant beneath a
faint and spiritual breath.</p>

<p>It is an old story that love is sightless,
but that is the love which romps among
the roses and is blinded by their thorns.
There is another and a better tradition
that love's eyes pierce heaven, and this is a
great truth; for infinity is cold and vaporous
until man projects upon it his mortal
ideal, his conception of an earthly love
transfigured. When this beloved guide
appears throned above him as in the clouds,
he dares to lift his eyes, and there he reads
through its light the divine purports of his
existence. Is it a small thing to stand,
though but for a moment, searching infinity
undismayed? This is the celestial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
ocean to whose shore he is come; and now
"drawing towards and contemplating the
vast sea of beauty, he will create many fair
and noble thoughts and notions in boundless
love of wisdom, until on that shore he
grows and waxes strong, and at last the
vision is revealed to him of a single science,
which is the science of beauty everywhere ... beauty
absolute, separate, simple,
everlasting, which without diminution,
without increase, or any change, is imparted
to the ever growing and perishing
beauties of all other things."</p>

<p>To some the great perception comes but
late, rising from the ashes of love's common
furnace. But they whose hearts have never
been consumed in these roaring flames may
find it earlier; and purged from all taints
of jealousy and covetousness, may pass
straightway into the bliss of a higher union.
This is that supreme affiance and espousal
of the soul wherein they may be released
into a larger air, undelayed by the earthward
longings and gradual initiations of
seemingly happier men. Thus its servants
do not decline into slothful service, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
are strenuous always; raised above the
acquiescence of use, they never know the
cloying of fruition or suffer the barbarian
conquest of indifference. Their soul is
unaffected by material circumstance or
misfortune, and illuminates their lives as
often as in the silent hour of meditation
they concentrate their thoughts upon its
grace. The cup of earthly love, even the
noblest, is often dipped in Pyriphlegethon,
and the draught it offers scathes the palate
until its finest sensibility is for ever
dulled. Those who have quaffed this liquid
fire can no longer understand his mood
who leaves the roses and the wine to toil
through deserts in search of limpid water.
They think him madly ungrateful for God's
good gifts, a fool abandoning joy proved
and present for a shadow far and incomprehensible.
But they who have not denied
themselves are no longer fit judges of him
who has renounced. They cannot know
that by this renunciation the senses are
thrice refined, and receive as a vital influence
the stellar beam which falls chill and
ineffectual upon a grosser frame. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
cannot believe that this love from the
infinite distance wields as mighty a force
over renunciant lives as the near flame of
passion over their own. But, for all their
denial, it lives and puissantly reigns. It
reigns in very truth predominant, this
ideal love to which space exists not and
propinquity is nothing; and it will have
none for its subjects but those who by
bereavement or aspiration or intense purity
are inly prepared for its dominion.</p>

<p>Happy therefore are the shy if in the
midst of their tribulation they are guided
to the gateway of so bright a kingdom. It
may well be that we must first be led thither
by some dear-remembered and virgin form
once almost ours through earthly love, but
now joined to us only by an imperishable
and mystic union. Our sight may at
first need the embodied beauty to give it
the finer powers by which the revelation
of the ideal grows familiar to us, but is at
last attainable without mortal intervention
by an immediate flight of the soul. Until
that late day of enlightenment we must still
be set upon the celestial path by a touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of human tenderness; a pure yet sensuous
yearning must be ours when we are first
girded to the ascent. If there are beings
which attain the fulness of the ideal love
without the first inspiration of a fair earthly
form I know nothing in creation to which
they may be likened, nor had I ever part
in so rare an enfranchisement. The vision
that now entrances my soul first arose from
a living, breathing form radiant with earthly
brightness and instinct with every charm
which brings men fawning to the feet of
women. The sensuous frenzy which lovers
sing was also mine, the tremor of the heart,
the vibration of the very life; the deep
seventh wave of passion rioted through me
also. But from the first amazement of the
shaken being it was not given me to pass
through satisfaction into tranquillity; I
was held long in a whirl of trouble; in the
anguish of denial I learned initiation into
the mystery which is eternal and supreme.</p>

<p>It is good for some of earth's children
that passion should be stayed before it
makes ashes of the fancy; for if it does
but touch for a moment only to be with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>drawn
for ever, it does not destroy, but
by its meteoric passage kindles the imagination
with the glow of an incorruptible
flame. It is with them long enough to
brand upon memory the image which,
though never renewed before their bodily
eyes, by its very severance from perception
puts on an immortality of virginal grace.
Love is understanding, said the poet of
Heaven and Hell, and love ennobled
through renunciant years shall at the last
encompass the world. The sensuous glow
that first quickened the heart of youth is
transmuted into a purer fire akin to that
which moves the spheres.</p>

<p>To know this truth is their compensation
who are swiftly withdrawn from the warm
radiance of earthly love. They are stricken,
but before passion blinds them are rapt into
a high solitude, whence, if they truly love,
an infinite prospect is unrolled before them.
They know desire; but as their passion
was hopeless in this world, their steps were
mercifully set upon a new path, whereby
the bodily semblance of the beloved became
the symbol of spiritual comeliness, alluring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the beholder into the peace of a serene and
unworldly mood. A thin and rarefied ideal,
you say, a mirage which no wayfarer can
approach: experience rejects these subtleties,
and to these creations of a dream
human affection was never given. True,
to hearts established and content in happy
unions, to minds preoccupied with the near
cares and pleasures of a home, our distant
visions may appear frail structures wrought
in mist by homeless fancy. But for the
exiled heart they are not such, but verities
of abiding inspiration. For the ideal love
did not die with Plato, but came again in
medi√¶val Italy, and who shall say that even
our material age has banished it from the
earth?</p>

<p>No indeed it is not dead, the ideal love,
but indwells, a redeeming power, wherever
there are desolate hearts and minds to be
updrawn and united by its ministry; a
power so lustral in its nature, that no abject
and despairing thought creeps into its
presence but is purified and exalted by its
regard. This love brings hope and cheerful
constancy; with a shining falchion it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
affrights into their natal darkness the
monstrous forms of despair, and lends to
all work a secret charm of chivalry. It
sustains that high anticipatory mood to
which life is but a preparation, and the
bees buzzing round the honey-flowers seem
poor things toiling for an inessential gain.
Because it is mystic and transcendental it
is the predestined guide of all whom fate
holds removed from earthly love. This is
the old device of the world's failures, you
say, to trick themselves out in Plato's mantle
or the schoolman's cowl, and conceal their
spite beneath the pretensions of the mystic.
But I answer that the causes which moved
the Greek and the Florentine are still at
work among mankind to-day; they have
never ceased, however much obscured by
the glare of triumphant luxury or the stress
of miserable toil. Often when disillusion
has laid bare a soul, this love which did but
slumber awakes to contest with envy or
despair the possession of a wounded heart.
I aver that any exile from the happier earth
whose heart is pure, if he invokes this love
with ardent faith, may unbar his door and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
feel that it has passed his threshold. Let
us never be persuaded that the ideal world
is far from this earth of ours, or that the
way to it may not be daily traversed by
him who has submitted to the heavenly
guide. Not even the close entanglement
of common cares can avail to
keep such an one from his love; but as
Bishop Berkeley is said to have been able
to pass in a moment from the consideration
of trifling things to the throne of thrones
and the seats of the Trinity, so this lover
shall overpass with easy and habitual flight
the barriers that hold most men life-long
prisoners.</p>

<p>For to the Spirit that is chastened and
endures there is given a power of flight and
poise, by which, if it abandon itself to the
celestial wind, it may instantly remove from
the deeper planes of life, as a bird by the
mere slanting of its wings is carried in proud
quiescence into an upper region of the air.
He shall know instant release from the
leaguer of disillusion and vain solicitudes;
in the light of one beautiful and compassionate
countenance the unquiet memories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of failure shall give up their exceeding
bitterness.</p>

<p>And though the style and instinct of
modern life are hostile to such love, though
in prosperity it is ignored and in adversity
often overborne by a vain uproar of lamentation,
yet even in a self-indulgent and furious
world it still draws many to the severe
exaltation of its service. We cannot approach
the heights where a Plato and a Dante
walked with ease, but far beneath upon the
lower slopes we can draw a breath of new
life as we fix our weaker eyes upon the
glory which they saw so near. Although the
men who have there ascended are a supreme
company, we may yet presume to follow;
for let it never be said that the gods have
reserved for surpassing genius the consolation
of which lesser men have so much
deeper need. But he who would reach a
serener air must press forward strenuously;
for as a mountain may have one bare and
northern slope, and another sunlit and
clothed with verdure, and yet there may be
a path on each side to the summit, so it
is with the ascent to this felicity. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
lingers amid pleasant groves and laughing
waters; another, undistracted by the beauty
of any lower zone, but fixing his eyes upon
the far summit, crosses the chill rocky
slopes, never feeling the warmth of the sun
and only seeing his brightness reflected
from the highest peak. Though the ways
of the two travellers lie far apart until the
end, their endurance may be crowned with
the same reward; but he who knew no
dalliance and plucked no fruit has from the
beginning seen the goal clearly, and lived
steadfastly in its distant promise. And do
you tell me that this is not love or joy, you
who saunter in the verdant southern valleys
breathing a present happiness with the
perfume of a thousand flowers? Your way
may lead you upward after long vicissitudes,
but endurance will more swiftly fail you for
the last most arduous ascent. Very love is
of the heights, and he whose thoughts have
long been thither exalted will breathe with
least pain the attenuate upper air.</p>

<p>To this pilgrimage the diffident are foreordained;
it is their happiest hour when
they take staff and scrip and set out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
earnest for the shrine built among the
mountains. The gardens of Armida are
not for them, nor the warm breezes fragrant
of fruit and flowers; but the vision of a
far peak flushed at sundawn draws them
onward, and strength and peace are increased
upon them throughout the great
ascent. He is still too rich for pity to
whom renunciation brings these high and
enviable hours.</p>

<p>But the heavens are not opened every
day, and the adept of these mysteries must
walk the dull round of common life like
other men, not warmed as they are by the
glow of constant friendship, yet cheered by
intermittent flames of remembrance and
of hope. The real life of the diffident is
cunningly hidden from those around them,
for whom, indeed, it is wont to have faint
interest; but before you who have often
sought me out through fair and foul weather,
I may venture to undo the pack of small
resources which brings variety and distraction
into lonely days.</p>

<p>Firstly, I still dare to haunt the forecourts
of philosophy. Into her inner courts I may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
not penetrate, lacking the leisure which her
whole service demands; yet the loiterings
which I may still enjoy are to me like
voyages into a foreign country, and give my
mind the healthful enjoyment of change;
they are not long enough to bring that
whole detachment from daily life which, in
my case, might prove a perilous advantage.
All that I need for common use is a simple
rule based on a few fundamental thoughts
to give me a course upon the wayward
ocean, and though it be full of error as the
Almagest, yet it shall surpass the thumb-rules
of Philistia. It must be a doctrine
which allows imagination her right and
durable career, and therefore not be monist.
For materialism is too wildly imaginative at
the start: like a runner who at the outset
overstrains his heart and thereafter runs no
more, the follower of this creed, by his
postulate of a blind impersonal Law,
exhausts his power of speed and plods
henceforth eyes downward over flattest
plains of dulness. That my mind may
remain curious and alert in isolation, I must
conceive in the universal scheme a power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
that does not alone impel, but also draws
me forward. For were it true that the
sum of things blunders from change to
change, swept by blind force into uncharted
voids, I should abandon myself in despair
to that hopeless course, and drift indifferent
to the direction or the end.</p>

<p>Let me rather believe that if each several
idea is compacted by my active intelligence
out of some vast system of relations, then
only a supreme intelligence akin to man's
can brace together the whole system or
universal sum of things. For this earth, yes,
and all the complex of the spheres, exist
to me imperfectly as idea alone, nor can I
conceive them any complete existence apart
from a kindred but omniscient mind. Each
advance in human knowledge should then
be an infinitesimal approach towards the
supreme comprehension; and the aspiring
race of man is justified in that inchoation
of long hope which is folly to the single
life.</p>

<p>I would also believe that new relations
between things may be detected not merely
by the staid and ordered process of collating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
abstractions, which is science, but by swifter
and more genial methods of intuition.</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
"Hurrah for positive science,<br />
Long live exact demonstration!"<br />
</div></div>

<p>cried Walt Whitman, exulting over the filed
fetters of mankind; and let us all echo the
cry, nor ever forget the razed Bastilles of
superstition. But there glimmers a wealth
of truth in the penumbra beyond our
lanterns to which science will creep too
slowly without the aid of imagination.
Yet this truth may be seized by swift sallies
into the darkness, and assured to us as it
were by some dim apperception of the soul,
when the whole personality is made tense,
and subtly anticipates the cosmic argument.
Life is too short to renounce this daring:
the sense of kinship with the All-Consciousness
sanctions if not commands the right
adventure.</p>

<p>It was this feeling which led William
Blake to exclaim in his impulsive way, that
to generalize is to be an idiot, that direct
perception is all, and the slow process of
the inductive reason a devil's machination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
This method of intuition is to the more
sober method of science as the romantic
to the classical spirit in literature, permitting
to the individual mind a licence of noble
vagrancy. But it must be a law for the
ordinary intelligence to exercise the two
apart, else it will fall into sick fancies of
excitement, and by abuse of wild analogies
lose the vital art of balance and sane comparison.
Only the greatest minds, endowed
as it were with some divine genius of
extrication, may dare to practise the two
together. So Leonardo da Vinci drove
inference and intuition abreast without
disaster, and gathered from purple distances
of thought their wildest and most splendid
flowers. To him, as has been well said,
philosophy was something giving strange
swiftness and double sight, clairvoyant of
occult gifts in common or uncommon
things. The doom of Ph√¶ton awaits those
who now would follow that marvellous
course; but the poetic observation of
resemblances in things remote, which lent
so rich a colour to the science of the Renaissance,
may yet be trained in all our minds;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and the philosophy which trusts in the slow
suffusion of the worlds with intellectual
light will bless and encourage its reasonable
growth.</p>

<p>Such a philosophy brings also a living
sympathy with art. For the artist ever sees
a perfection of truth beyond his rendering,
yet always calling for expression; there is
something eternally missed by his highest
effort, and he can never know complacency.
The philosophy which conceives the gradual
growth of form through consciousness
towards a perfection infinitely removed,
yet in its remoteness drawing up our life
as the moon sways the tides&mdash;this surely
is the artist's wisdom. Idealism is like
love, <ins title="apora porimos">&#7940;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#945; &#960;&#8057;&#961;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#962;</ins>, holding us as it were
in touch with the intangible: it will have
us conceive the Absolute without that helpless
absorption in thought which changed
Amiel's life from a fountain to a vapour:
it would keep us near the surf and confluence
of things. Its function is not to
give any mysterious transcendental knowledge,
but to serve culture "by suggesting
questions which help to detect the passion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and strangeness and dramatic contrasts of
life." And not only to bring suggestions,
but repose, by granting to eyes wearied
with minute concerns the contrasts of vast
times and spaces, the majestic idea of the
Whole; to change the focus and variously
dispose the perspectives of familiar things.</p>

<p>An old watchmaker, whose window overlooked
a wide meadow, used ever and again
to lay down his instruments to gaze out
upon the expanse of green, pasturing upon
it a wandering vague regard, and absorbing
from it an assuagement of his wearied senses
which, he said, served him more effectually
after these bright interludes. The province
of Metaphysics should be to us as to this
wise workman his field; not a place to
dream our days away in, but for occasional
resort; in which we may forget the infinitesimal
in healing visions of broad space
and colour. I counsel every lonely man to
satisfy what has been described as the
common metaphysical instinct, and according
to his powers to become a metaphysician.
There is no discipline which so well consists
with solitude, none which so instantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
enfranchises the mind from the tyranny of
mean self-interest or vain and envious
polemics. Men do not grow sour and
quarrelsome about the Absolute: everything
that is polemical is inspired, as
Michelet once said, by some temporal and
momentary interest. The man who has
climbed to the Idalian spring comes down
benevolent. He does not grudge this toiling
ant his grain, that snarling dog his
bone, but is content to live serene, in the
certainty that his soul has great provision,
and that though all human things are small,
each is worth its while. Into his hand
there is given a scale by which life is known
in its fair proportions; a tranquil joy,
disturbed neither by dirges nor Epinician
odes, is poured into his heart and exalts
him above distraction. He respects himself
as akin to that great Self whose perfection
shall one day be known; he understands
the passion for the ideal through which men
die young; he wonders at envy and in the
happiness of enfranchisement would have
all men free.</p>

<p>The pages of this Almagest are for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
exceptional hour; but daily, as one bookish
from the nursery, I read much in many
directions. For if books are called the best
friends of happy men, to the sad they are
saviours also. And when I remember too
clearly what I am, I turn perhaps most
often to Lucretius. For of all those who
have taken up the pen to assuage the
miseries of men, it is he who sings most
bravely of the great endurance. This
austere enthusiast, whose soul was never
fused in the fire of friendship; who went
apart, as it were, amid thunders upon the
lonely heights; who, without any lover,
yet loved his kind so well that all the years
of his maturity, how short and splendid a
period, were poured forth in one song of
human consolation,&mdash;this man for all the
madness of his creed, was yet aflame with
a wisdom to be called divine. That calm
face, lit with one desire&mdash;to drive the furies
from the way and soothe the frightened
children of men, is ever among the nobler
countenances which fancy summons about
my bed. Over the anxious heart they
flow, those slow cadences, so vibrant yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
so magnificently passionless, until the nerves
of pain cease to throb, and fear shrinks as
a taint impossible to the patient of such a
physician. It is not his to intimidate or
denounce, to evoke visions of lurid hell, to
linger over dire vaticinations, or apportion
to each his grade of torment, but with
cool fingers to smooth the hair back from
the forehead, and in grave, tender accents
to say: Sleep now, for it was a dream.</p>

<p>Landor, in a fine passage, compared the
merciful tolerance of the Roman poet with
the pitiless ire of Dante, contrasting in
respect of the quality of mercy these two
poets, one in their austere perfection, but
so different in their vision of death, and
judgment, and ultimate reward. The seer
of lost worlds has written his own defence,
and was indeed but attacked to point the
sharp antithesis; but Lucretius, though he
owes it to a literary feint, is very finely
praised. And to me it seems that his
compassionate mood increased upon him
just because he was not emulous of the
world's gifts or earnest for its pleasures,
but withdrew from the press, and lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
out his few great years contemplating apart
the vicissitudes of orbs and men. He did
not wait in ante-chambers or sit at wedding
feasts; but severing all entangling and
intricate threads of observance, followed
the voice which called him to solitary
places of illimitable prospect. It was not
through disillusion or injustice, or wounded
pride, that he walked aloof; but loneliness
was his birthright, and from the hills and
headlands to which solitude allured his
steps he saw the dust of mad encounters
rise to heaven, and the rent sails of foundering
galleys. He saw, and could not but
be wrung with pity for man deafened to
wise counsel by the noise of vanities, and
fiercely conspiring to precipitate his doom.
As he went by shore and upland, there
gathered in his mind those resonant hexameters
of warning or consolation, those
similes from the life of husbandry and dumb
things, which, set like diamonds in clay,
lend to the most arid arguments their own
incomparable splendour, or that homelier
beauty which instantly pierces the defences
of the heart. Not diffident as we, but of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
a nature so infinitely absent and reserved
that in the legend his wife must concoct a
philter to remind him of his love, he is of all
the pagans the best companion for our
angrier moods. An archaic and elemental
serenity is upon his language and thought,
rebuking our unprofitable petulance; if
emotion gains him he finds utterance in
those tremendous periods "where single
words seem to gather out of the deep and
to reverberate like thunder." As the reverberation
dies away and the clouds are pierced
by the sun, the world is seen in new lights
through an air clear as upon rain-swept
mountains.</p>

<p>As my reading is incessant, so also is my
writing. For the happiness of man is in
his fertility, and of barrenness comes the
worst despair. To be happy is to have
issue&mdash;children, or books written, or things
beautifully wrought, or monuments of goodness
to live after you, if only in the memory
of some tiny hamlet of the folded hills.
This is the law of life that Diotima knew,
by which flower and tree, animal and man,
fulfil the end of their creation; and man in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
nothing more surely proves his lordship
than by his many-handed hold upon posterity.
For the lower creation is procreant
in one way, but man in many; who may
have offspring not of body alone but of
mind and heart, and be so redeemed from
the grim dismay of childlessness. The
greatest human happiness is to be fertile
in every way, a thing granted rarely in
the world we know; the next, perhaps, is
that of the parent who gives all of himself
to his family, not tilling any field beyond
the charmed walls confining his desire.
The author sure of his fame, the born artist,
the benefactor of his kind, are also happy,
seeing their offspring grow in years and in
the power of making a brighter world.</p>

<p>But he is miserable who, aspiring to follow
these, feels his force wane within him while
he remains yet fatherless; or who has
sons stillborn, or weakly, or dishonoured.
I question whether sheer degradation into
evil brings more pain to man than such
sense of sterility or frustrate parentage. But
it is no small part of human redemption that
none need know the interminable misery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
A man may have neither sons nor genius,
but in the dark hour he can go out and
give, if it be only a penny or a kind word,
and on that foundation build a temple
to receive his thanksgiving. To give of
yourself is good. This is that grand agreement
and &oelig;cumenical consent to which
those words <i>quod ab omnibus quod ubique</i> in
deed and truth may be applied. For this
reason meanness is of the deeps, and avarice
groans in the lowest zone of hell. And if
there are faces of blank and permanent
despair upon your path, be sure that these
are not masks of whole men, but of
those who wilfully abstained from joy and
have received the greater damnation. My
children are mostly writings, poor weakly
creatures dying inarticulate and unchristened,
tenderly remembered by myself only,
but at least no nuisance to the world. I
loved them at their birth, I hold them in
remembrance, though they were ever of a
hectic and uncertain beauty.</p>

<p>The comparison of children with branches
of the olive is not the mere ornament of a
Bible verse, but the wisdom of one who knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
both tree and child. For as children are
bright creatures of swiftly changing moods,
so are the olive leaves in the blue southern
air. I once read of an artist who essayed
to paint a group of olives and a cypress
growing before them. Against their silvery
leaves its dark burnished form stood finely
mysterious, the contrasting grey lending it
a depth of almost sable colour; all was
propitious for his work. Then suddenly,
the air being to all seeming quite still,
the grey-green leaves began to shake and
quiver, until each olive tree was like a silver
bonfire, tremulous with a thousand waves
of white flame flowing and following along
the branches. It was a revelation and
swift effluence of life, perplexing and full
of charm. The brush was laid down, the
moment of inspiration gone, before the
capricious leaves ceased their quivering to
be robed once more in grey, casting on
the ground that translucent shadow which
tempers the sunlight only, and does not
spoil it of its gold. In the end the
canvas was covered, but with a sketch far
less true and beautiful than the painter's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
first happy vision. Even so of all our
children few attain the perfection of our
dreams. While we look, some influence
comes upon them and they are changed,
some breeze, born we know not where,
stirs them to their heart of joy while we
stand perplexed; innumerable laughter of
leaves, a rushing and a shivering in quick
answer to a mere breath, silence as swift
when unperceived it dies away&mdash;these are
their replies to our silent invocations. We
cannot follow the swift course, but are
quickened with a glad rejuvenescence, the
true prize and guerdon of parentage.
They may grow old or die, or bring us
sorrow; it is enough that once they so
lived and stirred a pride within us. Let
Hedonist and idealist dispute, let one
worship pleasure and another wait on the
intangible joy, but in the fathering and
mothering and the bringing up of young
children, of the flesh, the mind, or the
spirit, lies the natural happiness of men
and women. It is a joy which outlasts
disillusions; it rests surely upon achievement
and deserts which lie ponderable in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the archangel's scales. For it is certain
that he who creates as best he knows best
serves God, the world and himself, and
what system of Ethics has conceived a more
perfect rule?</p>

<p>All young life is instinct with such a
beauty and trustfulness, that though he
himself may have no part or lot in its
creation, and be dumb or awkward in its
presence, a man will be the brighter for
having passed, if but for a moment, out of
the darkness of his own course into the
radiance within its orbit. To the diffident
this is an especial grace. For children by
some deeper intuition understand us as
their parents cannot do; and when all the
world is cold will often smile upon us with
happy upturned faces. It is one of my
consolations that the little players in the
parks come running to me rather than to
others with their eternal question after
the exact hour of day. For I reflect that
though my face grows wrinkled and drawn
with years, there must yet hover something
about its ugly surface which tells of a good
will within. There was a time when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
found the children's question importunate,
and drew out my watch ungraciously; but
now I feel disappointment if during their
hours of play I can walk my mile without
answering one of these high-pitched
inquiries.</p>

<p>To have the confidence of children is
indeed a thing of which a poor wanderer
may be proud, a credential confirming his
self-respect, and worthy one day to be
presented at the gate of heaven. Once
during one of my worst hours of desolation,
when I was tramping across the fields, I
found a little maid of seven picking primroses
on the edge of an old orchard. For
some time I stood watching, so charmed
with the grace of her movements and the
beauty of the spring sunlight on her golden
mane, that I lost all consciousness of present
trouble, and beyond her fairy form began
to see vague visions of lost happiness returning.
As I stood thus forgetful and looking
absently before me, I suddenly felt a touch
which recalled my scattered thoughts: she
had come to me and put her hand in mine.
I think in all my lonely life I never felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
so swift a thankfulness as that which suffused
me then: the memory of it is always
with me, and now I never see a happy
child engrossed in its little task of duty or
pleasure without thinking to myself there
is one of those who truly have power to
remit sins. I will not repeat the fond things
often written about children. Not all of
them are like the infant angels of Bellini
or Filippino Lippi or Carpaccio; some
indeed are strident, pert, without charm
or candour, not doves but little jays; but
for the loveliness of those who have smiled
upon me, whether rich or poor, whether
wild or tended flowers, I shall ever hold
the whole company dear.</p>

<p>Whether I read or write, or go painfully
upon difficult paths of thought, like many
other men whom the world dismays, I win
a larger tranquillity and a clearer vision
from an increased simplicity of life. I
know that to use the word asceticism of
one's daily practice is to incur the judgment
of all those whom the world calls
good fellows, whose motto is live and let
live, or any other aphorism of con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>venient
and universal remission. To them
asceticism is the deterrent saintliness which
renounces all joy, and with a hard thin
voice condemns the leanings of mankind
to reasonable indulgence. The ill-favour
drawn down by ecclesiastical exaggeration
upon the good Greek word <ins title="ask√™sis">&#7940;&#963;&#954;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</ins>, which
means nothing more than the practice of
fitness, has prejudiced men against all
system of conduct bold enough to include
it in their terminology.</p>

<p>Kant's chapter on the Ascetic Exercise
of Ethics is a fine defence of that training
of the heart and mind which has no affinity
with the morbid discipline of hair shirt
and scourge. "The ascetic exercise of the
monasteries," he says, "inspired by superstitious
fear and the hypocritical disesteem
of a man's own self, sets to work with self-reproaches,
whimpering compunction and
a torturing of the body. It is intended not
to result in virtue but to make expiation
for sins, and by self-imposed punishment
the sinners expect to do penance, instead
of ethically repenting." And again&mdash;"All
ethical gymnastics consist therefore singly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
in subjugating the instincts and appetites
of our physical system ... a gymnastic
exercise rendering the will hardy and
robust, which by the consciousness of
regained freedom makes the heart glad."</p>

<p>This is sound doctrine, neither ungodly
nor inhuman, the word of a man in whose
veins the warm blood yet flowed. Few
pictures of venerable age please more than
that of the old philosopher of K√∂nigsberg
drawn for us by de Quincey in one of his
miscellaneous Essays. There we see Immanuel
Kant, leading his tranquil sane
existence, giving his friends sober entertainment,
talking brightly of mundane
things, practising "the hilarity which goes
hand in hand with virtue." For me the
very eccentricities of his daily routine have
a fascination, and I read them as a devout
Catholic reads many a quaint passage in the
<i>Acta Sanctorum</i>. How wise was his nightly
habit, as he settled himself in bed before
falling asleep, to asseverate with a sigh of
thankfulness that no man living was more
contented and healthier than he! Here is
the true asceticism, the child's glad aban<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>donment
to nature maintained and grown
articulate in philosophic age.</p>

<p>To this beauty of plain life I cannot
attain. But my own life is as far removed
as may be from brilliant or luxurious
pleasures, and I divide my time between
the country and the town. This I do
from obedience to reason rather than
fashion; for while the country has my
love, the city is more remedial to my
peculiar pain. There the shy man may
have what Lamb called the perfect and
sympathetic solitude, as opposed to the
"inhuman and cavern-haunting solitariness,"
to which his infirmity inclines. There he
and those who rub shoulders with him on
the pavement can "enjoy each other's
want of conversation." No creature with
a heart can jostle daily with his kind, but
he wins some consciousness of kindly feeling.
The very annoyances and constraints of
propinquity are in their own way disciplinary,
and insistent, uncongenial persons, like
glaring red buoys with clanging bells, serve
at least to keep us in the fairway of navigation.
And in a city there are voices of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
cheerful exhortation always echoing in the
higher air above the roar and the trampling,
which in the interludes of coarser sound,
or by our removal into some quiet court
or garden, may be heard repeating their
stirring watchwords of endeavour. We are
told that no word spoken ever dies,
but goes reverberating through space for
ever. It is my fancy that only evil words
escape into the outer void, which eternally
engulfs their profitless message, while words
of hope and helpfulness are not thus
lightly sundered from the world that needs
them, but hover still near above us, descending
with every lull of the tumult
into those ears which are strained towards
them. The laden air of towns carries not
the rumour of the battle only, but by the
presence of these fair echoes held within it,
gives back to the soul more health than
ever it drew from the body. With this
thought I am often consoled as I go my
way through gloom and clamour and unloveliness,
finding a Providence in places
which else seem abandoned in the outer
desolation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor is the vast city to be valued only for
what it gives, but for its own wonderful
self, an obvious point which need not be
expanded into a tedious circle. The shy
will naturally draw more advantage from
so rich a field of contemplation than those
who seldom walk alone. In London I
often map out a course of wandering which
in its varied stages shall remind me of the
change in progress or decay of particular
arts or industries or different quarters of
the town. Reading their meaning in the
light of history, I make bare walls speak to
me with a personal voice. Let any one
but acquaint himself with the styles of
ecclesiastical or domestic architecture, or of
monuments of the dead, or with the history
of the thoroughfares he frequents, and he
will be pleasantly constrained to reflection
upon those who have gone before him. As
he stands in the shadow of an ancient church
he will think to himself: "By this very
wall Chaucer may have stood." As he
walks amid the reverberating ravines which
are city streets he will say: "Here along
green and silent paths the Roman legionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
marched when Hadrian ruled the world."
When once the faculty of observation has
been awakened to a permanent alertness, the
desire to be widely read in history of men
and their arts will become irresistible; and
through the knowledge gradually amassed
it will be thought a sorry chance if any
ramble of wider compass yield no vision
which in comeliness or deformity tells its
tale of changing fortune. To appreciate
human work, and the conditions under
which it is born, is to exult in abounding
sympathy with this man's conquest
over things poor in promise, or to condole
with that man's failure to do the best that
in him lay.</p>

<p>As I walk by the strand of Thames, my
fancy sees upon one flood the gay barge
gliding upward to green fields, and the
black hull bearing down the prisoner to
the Traitors' Gate. If I go up Holborn,
I remember that where this traffic now
thunders John Gerard tended his Physic
Garden when Elizabeth was queen. I know
where Sarah Siddons lived; and where
William Blake died; and my curious wan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>derings
are now so far extended, that when
I turn to the great book of London I seldom
find a tedious page. The places where
people strove and suffered evoke before me
the forms of men and women dead but
unforgotten, and if I am alone I am not
aware of loneliness.</p>

<p>London is the central wonder, but wonderful
also in spirit and suggestion are
those old places which ring it round: these
I often frequent at every season, and
carry their portraits over my heart. Let
a man once learn to know them, and his
memory shall never starve; he will never
forget the hour when first they yielded him
up their secret. Many moments of intimate
delight do I treasure in remembrance,
moments when I was suddenly aware that all
previous impressions were the poor gatherings
of purblind eyes; but I will only tell you
of one, which may suffice to show what
riches lie ever open to those who roam in
solitude.</p>

<p>It was mid-April and the close of a
cloudless day. I had been to the Observatory
hill at Greenwich to see the sun set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
over London, looking for such a transfiguration
of the grey city as should reveal its
line of warehouses lying along the horizon
in a mist of splendour like the walls of
the New Jerusalem. So I had seen it
before, marvellous and refined in unearthly
fire: but to-day, in a sadder mood, and
hungering more deeply for the vision, I
looked out to the west in vain. For the
wind had set in from the east, and driven
back upon the town a zone of iron-grey
smoke, ragged along its upper edge like a
great water blown to spray, but merging
below with those gloomy and innumerable
buildings. Upon this the sun, which all
day had ridden in a clear air, was slowly
falling, losing radiance with every minute,
until as it approached that gloomy spray it
was luminous no more, but a dull red orb
whose light, like a flame withdrawn into
the consumed heart of coals, glows for
awhile beneath a gathering film of grey.
In a few minutes it descended, as if sadly
and of resolution, into the murky sea,
where for a moment its red curves seemed
to refine the smoke into translucency;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
but at last the dun waves gathered upon
it dark and voluminous, drowning it so
deeply that the clearer sky above was
instantly robbed of the wonted after-glow.
Some pale reflection there was in the upper
heaven, ensuring a time of twilight, but
no glory; and smitten with a congruous
sadness, I went down to the river. But
there, pacing to and fro as if upon a quarter-deck,
with the water lapping upon the wall
beneath, I lived one of the happy hours of
life, redeemed from disappointment, and
carried far into a magical world.</p>

<p>The flood tide, which had turned for
more than an hour, was now racing down
wilful for the sea, though the breeze ruffling
its surface seemed to thwart and stay its
eager course. And on the surface, indeed,
chafed and broken into innumerable ripples,
the wind triumphed; but as one looked
westwards towards the city, it was clear
that the sullen strength of stream and
tide had the mastery. For over the broad
curving reach, lit like white unburnished
silver with the reflection of the pallid sky,
there glided forward a line of barges each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
with every red sail set, and as silent as if
they sallied from a besieged city. One by
one they hung out their lights, the lamps
swaying and casting yellow bars over the
quivering water, until in perfect silence
all passed down before me. Each in turn
attaining the lower bend where the river
sweeps northward, went about and stood
for the Middlesex shore; and then for a
moment the wind seemed to overcome the
tide, for before the boat could win new
way, lying almost broadside across the
stream, the breeze held her motionless, like
a tired bird on a windy day when it flies
out from the shelter of the wood. It was
but for a moment, and then the blunt
bows glided forward towards the north
bank, and another barge succeeded in the
gathering gloom.</p>

<p>And so it was until all were passed. The
departing light drew the colours from the
red sails and the silvery brightness from
the river; all forms became outlined in
black upon what uncertain light remained.
Two men put off in a boat from an anchored
ship; the mingled sound of their oars and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
voices came with subdued tone as if out of
an infinite distance. Then the whole reach
lay bare and silent for a while, and only the
little waves lapping upon the stone steps
played an accompaniment to my dream.</p>

<p>The hour and the place compelled to
reverie, and memory consenting to their
evocative charm, I peopled the still scene
with the forms of those who had swayed or
shared the fortunes of this land; imperious
Elizabeth and gentler Mary, the slight
heroic figure with one sleeve pinned empty
on the breast, and all those who, going down
to their business in deep waters or returning
therefrom, have saluted with melancholy
or with joy these towers and this wooded
hill. I thought of the lads playing beneath
these trees, and so inbreathing the spirit
of this place that for them there was no
career but to follow the river down to
ocean, and ocean himself in his circuit of
the world. I thought of the veterans
returned from that quest, old Argonauts
of a later day, now clustering round the
Hospital fires and perhaps recalling amid
tales of havens and high seas the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
morning when they first dropped round
the bend and passed into the new world
beyond. For this Thames is such an avenue
and entry into marvellous life that earth
can show no greater rival, none more rich in
dignity or in the multitude of its merchandise.
And if the flood of that merchandise
shall cease, and the stream once more go
lonely to the sea or carry coracles, it cannot
be again as if it had never borne great ships,
or swung the Admiral's galley on its tide.</p>

<p>It is good for an Englishman to stand
here and listen to the brown waters lapping
on the old walls and caulked timbers; to
hear, as an under murmur, voices of Lechlade
and Bablockhythe, for all intervening
leagues of wood and meadow not altogether
lost: before this persistence and continuity
of youth to feel high thoughts stir within
him and solemnize the nativity of new
resolve. You cannot feel beneath your feet
these old stones trodden by the great
generations of your own blood and kindred,
and not be moved to walk uprightly, to
be approved by their shades as one not
unworthy of such descent. For whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
such worn stones be in the aisle of some
great minster, or here, paving this narrow
way for hurrying feet, the inspiration is as
strong and the thankfulness not other.
For this is a place of meridian, the navel
of our land and empire; the wind searching
its alleys has no usual voice, but as it were
a deep and oceanic sound, according with
old ballads and stories of the sea.</p>

<p>I lingered leaning upon the rail until
the tide had fallen from the wall, tracing
along the narrow pebbled foreshore a clear
marginal line of irregular contour, now
sinuous, now straight, but palely luminous
like a silver tone on some enamel of old
Italy, a line drawn by a master draughtsman,
in its inevitable and sure perfection wholly
satisfying the eye. With the dark bank it
vanished towards the great city, now marked
in the upper sky by a hovering brightness
of light escaped beyond the smoky rampart
to tell the effort of innumerable lamps
beneath, all pouring their blurred and vain
effulgence to the disdainful stars.</p>

<p>Moreover, the city will give the shy man
all the consolations of art, philosophy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
literature of which his education or experience
may have made him worthy. He
can see great pictures or read great books
at little cost, and find in them the truest of
friends in need. It is so obvious that a
solitary of any culture will find relief with
such companions, that here I take for
granted his resort to their aid, and will
only mention two resources from which
the real recluse often draws less advantage
than he might, I mean orchestral music
and the drama. Any man of feeling who
hears a great symphony ceases to be self-centred
with the first movement; he goes
out of himself, and rides upon waves of
sound, exalted by this majesty of collective
effort. No other music thrills his whole
being like this, which sweeps him with all
around into the very course of changing
fates. In the confluence of dim hopes and
passions which rise above the harmonies
like smoke-wreaths riding the red flame,
the soul glows interfluous with other souls
and is elated with the inspiration of their
presence. He bears arms exulting who
never had comrades till now; his will is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
absorbed in confederate joy and human
force unanimous. In this abandonment of
the whole being, the diffident know their
fellows near, and in the ecstasy of shared
emotion learn the full measure of their
humanity. Philosophers in all ages have
known and taught the power of music in
compelling ten thousand to the love of one,
and so ennobling an infinite multitude in
the glow of a common emotion. Sound
was the first instinctive language, one for
man and winds and waters; and music,
which is the development of this primeval
converse, leaving to grammars the expression
of cold and abstract thought, has
gathered about her in her mountain caverns
the echoes of all sighs sad or passionate, of
all inarticulate cries born of aspiration or
desire, and there blended them into eternal
harmonies which at her word flow forth
and join the hearts of men.</p>

<p>Indeed, that swift responsiveness of feeling
which music thus awakes is a gift beyond
gems of Golconda; not youth's swift effusion
cheaply given and soon forgotten, but the
vibration of a heart stirred in sympathy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
some profound note of life, as the dyed
pane stirs and quivers when the organ gives
forth its deepest tones. Sentiment is a
draught of old wine passing into the veins
and enriching the blood, until in the
generous glow all the privations and the
stints of loneliness are forgotten. Pure
emotion is like righteous anger, which may
be lawfully indulged if the sun go not down
upon it; and as he who shrinks from all
fire of wrath lives but a vaporous life, so
he who will never be moved is proud of a
poor crustacean strength, like the limpet,
winning darkness in exchange for dull
stability. As for me, in the propitious
hour when the heart longs for expansion,
I give it honourable licence, and quicken
its unfolding by spells of magical words.
At such times I invoke the aid of passionate
souls, not shrinking even from the vain,
provided that they loved greatly and give
great expression to their humanity. Such
is that wild lover of George Sand whose
<i>Souvenir</i>, for all its rhetoric, charms like an
incantation. The ancients quenched the
ashes of the pyre with red wine, as if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
blood of the god-given vine could hearten
the spirit that yet hovered near. Over my
ashes let no wine be poured, but read me
such verses high and valiant, that if my
soul yet lingers undelivered from the earth's
attraction it may be regenerated and set
free into a braver life.</p>

<p>And let the lonely man be an assiduous
frequenter of the playhouse, for the drama
will also open the world's heart to him, and
that by a plainer and less elusive speech.
Seated in the theatre among his kind, he
knows a deeper pleasure than other men;
for while to these the changing scene brings
remembrance or anticipation of familiar
things, to him it reveals whole vistas of
life which, except in dreams, his feet may
never tread. When the curtain is rung
down, and he goes out into the street, for
a while at least his existence is transformed.
All those front doors aligned in their innumerable
sequence, which in daylight or
darkness he passes when he wanders alone,
are now no longer barred against him;
they open at the touch of his fancy, and
he sees within the light of homeliness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
where father, mother, and child weave
round warm firesides their close conspiracies
of affection. At last he knows what
is passing behind those bars; like an old
family friend he takes his place by the fire
and receives as of right the confidences
which in his real lonely life never find
their way to his ears. He helps the lovers
to build their cloudy castles, he reasons
away the parents' care, he goes up-stairs
with a shaded candle to look in upon the
children sleeping. Good women unlock the
jewel-caskets which are their souls; happy
maidens are sisterly with him; strong men
grapple him to their hearts and call him
friend. He that was vagabond has now
innumerable homes, and of the faces that
fleet by him out of doors there are always
some which seem to give him greeting.</p>

<p>These secret and unavowed alliances
transfigure the unlovely streets, and light
in the cavernous blank houses many a glowing
and familiar hearth. As he goes on,
careless of distance or direction, he is now
inwardly busy with fresh and delightful
dreams. He plights his troth and earth is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Eden; he imagines brilliant hours for the
dream-children who go by his side,
holding each of his hands. And if the
visions change, and sorrow or sin pass in
over a familiar threshold, what generous
abnegation, what pity, what righteous wrath
does he not know, until the plastic power
of fancy moulds out of this poor recluse
a man like other men. Amid these
visionary sympathies time goes quickly by,
and returning to his voiceless dwelling he
has stored up such wealth of dreams that
he can even endure the supreme test when
the lonely man finds himself sitting in the
wan light with no one near him to whom
he is dear. Of the strength and peacefulness
which bring him safely through that
hour of desolation he owes much to the
players, who have shot the drab texture of
life with an infinity of bright and tender
hues, so that he can bear to turn it in his
hands and look upon it with a wistful
pleasure. I say, then, let the shy man
frequent the playhouse, and there facet and
burnish his dulled mind until it reflects, if
it may not touch, the many-sided world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>For the discipline of sympathy, for the
quickened sense of comradeship in work,
for the very presence of that unloveliness
which compels sympathy, I dwell more
months in the town than in the country-side.
But remembering what Nature did
to save me, and owing her an endless debt
of filial duty, I return to her in the summer
days, and to make up for the long months
of separation cling nearer to her than most
of her truant sons. For communion with
Nature, the ideal joy of country life, is not
attained by the sportsman or the mere
player of games, who think of their bodies
chiefly, and use as a means to rude physical
vigour the end ordained for the fine contentience
of body, mind, and spirit. Again
I will pass by the obvious and familiar
resources of outdoor life, and speak only of
such as men are unaccountably prone to
neglect.</p>

<p>There is a way of learning nature which
in this wet land is mostly followed by
tramps and vagrants; the way of sleeping
beneath the stars. So far is this joy from
the thoughts of most men, that even George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Borrow felt a strange uneasiness when for
the first time the darkness descended upon
him in the open country. I think we
carry with us all our lives that fear of night
with which nursery tales inspired our childhood;
it reinforces the later more reasoned
fear of boisterous weather, or of the men
who walk in darkness because their works
are evil. We shrink from night as a chill
privation of daylight, as a gloom which
we must traverse, but not inhabit; the
distrust becomes with years instinctive and
universal, and the nearest approach to
friendly relation with night attained by
most of us is a timid liking for the twilight
hours. Yet as the sun rises alike upon the
just and upon the unjust even so does he
descend, and we put a slight upon Providence
if we abandon to rogues and rakes
that wonderful kingdom of the darkness
of which by natural prerogative we are
enfranchised. By never using our proper
freedom, we give them prescriptive licence
of usurpation, so that the hours in which
the heavens are nearest to us are become
the peculiar inheritance of thieves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>I confess that on the night when first I
set out to do without a bedroom I too felt
all the force of the traditional mistrust.
I heard human whispers in the wind, and
saw the shadows of walls and trees as forms
of men lurking to spring out against me.
The movements of roosting birds startled
me as I passed; the sudden silences startled
me more. And when I had spread my gear
on the ground and settled down to rest,
the sense of exposure on every side made
sleep impossible; time after time I seemed
to hear footsteps stealthily approaching;
and there was a strangeness pervading
everything which to my nervous fancy was
simply provocative of apparitions. This
lasted many nights; and whether I established
myself on the edge of a copse, or in
the open grass, or in a hammock beneath
two trees, I continued a prey to the same
uneasy wakefulness. But then, as if satisfied
of good faith by such perseverance, the
night began to wear a friendly aspect, the
shadows gave up their ghosts, and the
breezes became the expected messengers of
slumber.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>When the lonely sleeper-out has grown
familiar with the moonlight and the darkness,
he is admitted into the number of
earth's favoured sons; for lying like a child
upon her bosom, he hears her heart beating
in the silence, and wakes to see her smiling
in her beauty like a queen apparelled.
To no man slumber comes more gently
than to him; and his uprising is as that
of a child exulting in the cloudless day.
Health and innocence return to him, and
his one sorrow is that he has lived into
maturity without continually partaking of
these sane and natural delights. Remorse
is his that for all these years he has feared
the dews and shrunk from the bland night
airs; and remembering the needless imprisonment
of a hundred chambers, he
mourns over the irrecoverable hours which
would have rooted his life more deeply in
tranquillity and strength. But the June
sun is up, and the birds are singing: he
strides with light step over the grass, watching
the rabbits play in the glades, and in
unison with a host of fellow-creatures
singing a welcome to the dawn. When it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
is time for him to think of home and he
comes once more beneath a doorway, he
has a mind refreshed by the quietude of
dim space, and a heart replenished with
innocence and good-will. He who so
sleeps hates no man, and will go upon the
dullest way free from petulance or despair.
The scent of the rich earth is in his
nostrils, and the clearness of morning air
has passed into his eyes.</p>

<p>I have made my lair in many places since
I first kept house with Nature. I have
couched in heather by the pines of hills
far above the Sussex Weald; I have lain
in dry furrows or on the margin of a copse,
or in the parks of the children of fortune,
for whose welfare, in gratitude for their
unconscious hospitality, I shall ever pray.
But of all wild resting-places I have known,
the openest are the most delightful. To
see the whole sweep of the stars; to lie
on the shorn ground free of all that overshadows
or encompasses or confines; to
breathe in the great gulf of air; to stretch
unhindered limbs&mdash;this is an initiation into
a new life, a pleasant memory in the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
glooms of winter. Let nothing come between
you and the stars, that they may
look well upon your face, and haply repenting
of some ancient unkindliness, draw you
at this rebirth a new horoscope of blessing
and fair fortune. And if slumber tarries
when you lie in an open spot, you may
consciously ride the great globe through
space, and like the shepherd watching by
his flock in the clear night while star rises
after star, grow aware of the great earth
rolling to the east beneath you.</p>

<p>In these still hours of night or early
dawn there steals upon the charmed mind
an Orphic sense of worship and inexplicable
joy. For here on bare uplands and wooded
hills, where the starlight rains down through
the silence, or the day, welling up over the
rim of the downs, glides fresh from the lips
of ocean, a calm river of light, here is the
place of Dionysus, of him born from fire
and dew, Zagreus the soul of clean souls
and wild lives, his heart a-quiver with
vague sadness drawn from all the worlds,
Eleutherios, loosener of heart and lip, the
regenerator, the absolver, the eternally mis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>understood,
whose true followers are priests
of impassioned pure life, whose wine is not
juice of grapes but the clear air ambient
upon the hills. Here when sleep is shamed
away by expectant awe, the whole being
grows one with all-environing life; personality
glides into the stream of cosmic
existence, lost and found a thousand times
in the trance and ecstasy of dim divine
feelings beyond the power of words inexpressible.
It is miracle; it is religion;
it is a feast of purification above pomps or
mysteries, a cleansing ritual without victims
and undefiled. In such hours, and in such
hours alone, man and things are joined in
a supreme utterance of life high and humble,
transient and immortal, by which the
fellowship of all existences within the
universe is made real and significant to
the initiate mind. For in the day fences
are about us, roofs and towers impend
above our heads, we are cribbed in streets
and markets, the din of rhetoric or sordid
bargaining fills our ears. Or if we withdraw
into some still chamber, yet the walls
built by hired hands offend, and the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>posts
of sapless timber; no high influence
can penetrate to us save through the close
court of memory, and compared with the
breezy starlit meadows, how poor an avenue
to the soul is that!</p>

<p>And the exuberant sun of noon distracts,
and the multitude of his beams is troublous,
for what does sight avail if the things of
the heart's desire are lost in immeasurable
perplexities of light? For in the high day
the quivering bright air is more opaque
than the dim spaces of night, so tranquil
and severe, or the glowing kingdoms of the
morning. At the springing of the day the
eyes open upon awakening flowers, giving
filial heed to the marvellous earth which
waits in patience for a human greeting.
I like the passage in which Chaucer tells
how in May-time his couch was spread in
an arbour upon the margin of the grass,
that he might wake to see the daisies unfold
their petals. Sleeping thus, he also must
have known those intervals of slumber
when a sense of some impending wonder
grows too strong for sleep, and all nature
seems calling to high vision. Often I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
have been thus awakened, not by noise or
movement, but as it were by some strange
prescience of beauty constraining me to
rise and look. Once I was drawn some
distance round the corner of a copse, and
there, low in the sable-blue of the sky, in
a rivalry of intense but dazzling light, the
crescent moon hung splendid over against
a great constellation which glittered like a
carcanet of diamonds. They seemed to
speak together as if in some scene or passage
of celestial drama, nor did I know which
was the diviner speech, the moon's unwavering
effulgence or that leaping coruscation
of the stars. Nothing stirred on the
right hand or the left, but earth and air
were hushed, as if before that colloquy all
sound and motion were miraculously holden.
Tall trees brown with densest shadows were
massed upon one side, obscuring half the
heaven, and lending by their contrasted
gloom that sense of wizardry in natural
things which enchants the clear summer
nights when the air is still.</p>

<p>This is but one among many visions of
which the remembrance makes life worship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>ful;
and it is pity that at the hour of
their coming well-nigh all whom they should
delight lie chambered within brick walls,
lost in sleep or in the mazes of unprofitable
thoughts. For these things in their rare
appearances are more precious than an
hour's slumber, were it dreamless as a
child's, or all the watches of luxurious
unrest. If another summer is given me
I hope to take the road when July has
come with balmy nights, and wander days
at a stretch with all I need upon my
shoulders. Then I shall know the real
joy of vagrancy, caring little where night
finds me, and quickening my steps for
nothing and for no man. I shall linger in
every glade or on every hill-top which
calls to me to stay; I shall tell all the
hedgerow flowers, and lean over the gates
to watch the foals playing. The brooks
shall be my washing-basins, and I shall
quench hunger and thirst in the tiled
kitchens of lonely farmsteads. If I hear
the shriek of a train I shall smile when I
think of its cooped and harried passengers,
and plunge devious into some pathless wood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
in whose depths the only sounds are the tap
of the woodpecker's bill or the measured
axe-strokes of the woodman. I shall fling
myself down to rest under what tree I will,
and pulling from my pocket the book of
my choice, I shall summon a wise and
cheerful companion to my side as easily
as ever oriental magician called a jinn
to do him service. I shall once more be
commensal with wild creatures, and wonder
that solitude was ever a pain; I shall be
healthily disdainful of the valetudinarian
who lives to spoil either his body or his soul.</p>

<p>These are the wanderings which henceforward
will chiefly suffice to my need.
For since I roamed my fill in other
continents the gadfly may no longer sting
me out of my tranquil haunts. In their
youth lonely people suffer more than others
from that restlessness which fills the mind
with sudden distaste for the present scene,
and a fierce longing to be somewhere far
away. Others are preserved from it by
the love of home; but we, in our poverty
of attachment, listen more readily to the
depreciating voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>I remember how deep had always been
my longing to look out upon the sea
from some Greek island, and how one day,
when this desire was granted, and I walked
along hills set high above the blue √Ügean,
I was seized with an instant yearning to
be instead upon Ranmore Common in
Surrey. Yet at that moment a life's
ambition was being fulfilled; I stood in
a scene of incomparable beauty, gazing
down on those deep azure waters whose
voice is always to me as a lament for wandering
Odysseus; the lower slopes were
rich with olive trees, powdering with silver
the tilled lands round a beautiful monastery
lying there in its enchanted rest.
Dark cypresses rose amid white walls of
villages, by the contrast of their gloom
making all bright colours glorious; away
to the left, where the shore verged westward
tracing inimitable curves between field
and sea, lay slumbering a little white town
with minarets and walled gardens and
tiny haven&mdash;a very place for Argonauts;
and yet my thoughts turned to the chalk
downs of England and honeysuckle crown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>ing
the unfruitful hollies. <i>Sed quia semper
abest quod aves praesentia temnis</i>;&mdash;Such
desire has distracted Roman minds; the
perversity is very old; and perhaps only
children find no disillusion in the accomplishment
of a dream.</p>

<p>For our feet have one country and our
dreams another, and there is no constancy
in us. It is not alone in the bartering of
one earthly scene for its fellow that we
suffer the sick thirst of change; but into
the rarest hour of achieved ideal to which
hope promised her supreme satisfaction,
the same wayward longing will often find
a way; as in a sacred place amid the purest
and most exquisite meditations of the soul,
there will suddenly flit inexplicable shadows
of irreverence, with echoes of incongruous
voices from the abandoned world.</p>

<p>But now as the years pass and the penury
of human love has made the home woods
and fields more dear, I feel that this unrest
is drawing to its end. For as the seasons
pass over the uplands and the meadows,
clothing them with new splendours between
the seed-time and the harvest, no vision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
rises upon the memory dearer and more
beneficent than theirs. As the lover's fancy
dwells upon the image of his beloved in
this or that environment, and thus or thus
arrayed, so I see the woods and fields in the
various glories of the year and know not in
which garb I love them best. They have
heard my laments, my confidences, all my
broken resolves: they are bound to me by
so pure and intimate an affection that all
those grander wonders of the world should
never draw me again from this allegiance.
Not for the vision of Himalaya piercing the
heaven, or the sunsets of Sienna, or the
moonlight on the Taj Mahal, or for any
other beauty or any wonder shall I weary
of the cornfields framed in elms or the great
horses turning in the furrow against the
evening sky.</p>

<p>For with the growth of years our desires
wander less, and are mercifully contracted
to the scope of our wearying powers. We
haunt the same old places and want the
same old things, dwelling amongst them
with an increasing constancy of devotion.
For we find that year by year the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
places and things are not really the same;
something has touched them in our absence;
strange still agencies have intervened, long
silences of dissolution and the ineluctable
fate of change. And so that perfect sameness
which we find unattainable takes on
the quality of ideal and demands the
grown man's devotion, as the change that
is forbidden casts its resistless spell over the
guarded and tethered child. The eyes of
youth are on the far end of the vista, those
of age upon the near; the old horse that
has drawn the coulter through the clay is
glad for the four hedges of the paddock
which irk the growing colt's desire. When
Richard Jefferies was asked why he walked
the same lane day after day, at first he was
at a loss for a reply; but gradually the
reason became clear to him. It was because
he had become aware of the iron law:
<i>Nothing twice</i>: he wanted the same old
and loved things not twice but endlessly;
he was yearly more eager to be with them,
and paint indelibly upon his memory their
delicate quiet beauty, their soft and
perishable charm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>That is how I also feel, as with the
return of summer I wander out into the
old meadows and climb the familiar hills;
I find myself hoping that nothing is changed,
and am stirred with sweet anxieties of
reminiscence. And surely within the enchanted
boundaries of the counties where
I ramble, there is variety which not the
hundred eyes of Argus could exhaust.
These fields and woodlands in high summer
feast all the senses with a surfeit of delights.
How good it is to exercise in all its range
the fine mechanism of the body, suffering
each part of it to indulge its own hunger
after beauty; to feel the texture of petals,
and draw the long grasses through the
fingers; to breathe an air laden with the
scent of blossoms, passing from uplands
fragrant with bean-flowers into untilled
regions odorous with pines; to hear the
birds' chorus at sunrise and the distant
sound of reaping; to see innumerable
marvels; the belts of clover mantling
wine-dark in the wind; the poppies in the
standing corn, the carmine yew-stems on
the downs; above you the soft grey clouds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
delicately floating; below you, as the day
declines, some distant lonely water emerging
in its glory to be the mirror and refuge
of all heaven's light; to remember the
gorse and broom and look forward to the
royal purple of the heather&mdash;all this is a
consummation of pure life, a high, sensuous
pleasure penetrating to the inmost soul,
and of such exceeding price that to disdain
its offerings or to pass incurious before
them, is to live in the blindness of the
tribe of Genseric.</p>

<p>In such wanderings the mind is filled
with slow and seasonable thoughts, lasting
as the trees and buildings of the country-side.
Old deliberate contemplations, perceptions
after long regard ingathered from
abundant nature, theories leisurely compacted
in sunshine or storm, to stand in
the fields of memory, crowned with beauty
by the indulgent years. So in the visible
meadows stand the ancient barns, with roofs
of umber tiles parcel-gilded with old gold of
lichen, and crowning their seasoned timbers
"as naturally as leaves"; restful structures
of a quiet age, capacious of dim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
space, unvexed by the glare of a hundred
summers.</p>

<p>And if you ask what profit is here for
one who must do battle in the loud world,
study for a while the artifice and industrious
policy of plants by which they attract to
themselves the visitants they need or with
most masterful defence repel the importunate
advance, and you will return to
the societies of men, even to their parliaments,
enriched with arts of prudence
beyond the practice of Machiavel. Examine
the dog-rose upon the hedge, how
by putting forth thorns it raises itself to
the light and ranges irresistible along the
leafy parapets; see how the flowers adapt
their form and colour to the convenience
of the bee or the predilections of the bird;
consider the furze armed with spines against
browsing muzzles, and be near when it casts
its seed wide upon the earth; and then say
if among states or governments there is a
wiser economy or an intelligence more
provident of its end. I myself have the
conceit that if time, revoking my sentence
of superannuation, should restore my lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
years and add youth to the wisdom learned
along the hedges, even I, a very profitless
weed, should not again so uncivilly decay,
but flower to another June and see my seed
multiply around me.</p>

<p>Perhaps, if that might be, I should strive
to learn thoroughly, and bring science to
bear upon experience. But, as I am,
classifications and dissections are repellent
to my fancy. I cannot get to the hearts
of flowers by any Linn√¶an approach, but
go rather by the old animistic way, still
honoured by Milton through his Genius
of the Woods:</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
"When evening gray doth rise I fetch my round,<br />
Over the mount and all this hallowed ground,<br />
And early, ere the breath of odorous morn<br />
Awakes the slumbering leaves."<br />
</div></div>

<p>So I greet the blossoms of hill and upland
and water-meadow, knowing them all by
their country names, and sometimes fancying
that they know me back: all that is
lacking is the tutelary power to guard
their growth and prolong their bright and
fragrant lives. What fine old names they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
have, great with the blended dignities of
literary and rural lore; archangel, tormentil,
rosa solis or sun-dew, horehound,
Saracen's wound-wort, melilot or king's
clover, pellitory of Spain! I cannot coldly
divide so fine a company into bare genera
and species, but imagine for them high
genealogies and alliances by an imaginative
method of my own: to me the lily and the
onion shall never be connections.</p>

<p>If I must read books on flowers, I take
down such a one as Nicholas Culpeper's
<i>Complete Herbal</i>, written from "my house
in Spitalfields next the Red Lion, September
5th, 1653." For here is a man who attempers
science with the quaintest fancies
after the manner of his generation, and
delightfully misinterprets the real affinity of
the flowers and the heavens. "He that
would know the operation of the herbs
must look up to the stars astrologically,"
says this master; and so to him briony is
"a furious martial plant," and brank ursine
"an excellent plant under the dominion
of the moon." Of rosemary he says, "the
sun claims privilege in it, and it is under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the celestial ram," and of viper's bugloss,
"it is a most gallant herb of the sun."
The bay-tree rouses him to real eloquence,
though not for Apollo's sake. "It is a
tree of the sun and under the celestial sign
of Leo, and resists witchcraft very potently,
as also all the evils that old Saturn can do
to the body of man; for neither witch
nor devil, thunder nor lightning will hurt
a man in the place where a bay-tree is."</p>

<p>Reading in this old book of the ordinance
and virtues of the familiar herbs, I escape
from the severities of botanical science into
a maze of queer fancies, well suited to those
retrospective hours when we love best what
we least believe. And by the pleasant
suggestion of astrology I am led on to
contemplate the starry heavens, which I
do in the ancient pastoral way, peopling
them with mythical forms and connecting
them with the seasonable changes of rustic
toil. I forget for the moment all the
discoveries of Copernicus and Kepler, and
see eye to eye with Cleostratus of Tenedos
who nightly watched the stars from the
sacred slopes of Ida.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Much as the companionships of nature
have meant for me, I would not have any
man content himself with these alone. It
is not right to live the slave of Pales, or
become the rhapsode of docks and nettles.
To be all for the lower life, were it the
fairest, is derogation; and Har and Heva
before they may enter into their kingdom
of the flowers must first be fallen spirits.
But continually in the interludes of human
endeavour to rebathe the mind at these
clear wells does indeed exceedingly purify
and strengthen against the returning and
imminent encounter. Those long retreats
at Walden may not often be repeated, for
man is either risen too high or too far
fallen to live well in the sole company of
animals and flowers. What sociologists call
the consciousness of kind is as vital to man
as the consciousness of self; and to pine
for adoption into an alien kind is vain on
this side transmigration.</p>

<p>Not seldom my wanderings in town and
country lead me to quiet churchyards, or
to those vast cemeteries where the living
have established the dead in avenues and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
streets of tombs after their drear suburban
fashion. Solitude has ever persuaded to
the contemplation of death, and in these
silent places I feel no shock of sadness but
am rather possessed by a familiar spirit of
peace. As I wander from path to path,
my fancy is not lamed by mournful thoughts,
but finds suggestion amid the poor laconic
histories by which these headstones appeal
to him that passes by.</p>

<p>It is with most men a natural desire to
take their last rest in some green God's
acre, far from the smoke and turmoil of
towns, lying in a fair space amid a small
company, where there is a wide prospect
of tilled lands, and the reapers cut the
swathes against the very churchyard wall.
And this is my most usual aspiration; yet
there are times when I would not shrink
in thought from the Valley of Ezekiel,
and would be content to be written a mere
number in some city of the dead, where
at last after all the loneliness of life I should
no longer be kept apart, but be gathered
to my fellows where they lie in their
thousands, and be received a member of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
their society. And though I well know
that it matters not a cummin-seed whether
my bones are washed to and fro on the
bed of the sea or my ashes cast to the
winds of heaven, yet I humour this
fancy, and find a quiet pleasure in the
thought that death at least may end this
isolation.</p>

<p>And what if the propinquity of these
poor remains be gage and promise of a
sympathy of souls unveiled and unhidden
by false semblances of the body? Then
should death indeed be the crown of a long
desire and give me at the last the fellowship
into which life denied initiation.
Surely, as Coleridge dreamed, there is a
sex in souls, which, disengaged from the
coarse companionship of the flesh, shall see
into each other's crystal deeps. Thence, in
new life, when the last recondite secret is
withholden no longer, there shall come forth
those qualities and powers that ennobled
man and woman in mortality; they shall
come forth in all their several strength and
beauty, divinely animate, and reflecting
upon each other bright rays and soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
colours invisible upon these misty oceans
of our navigation.</p>

<p>It is not terrible to think, at times, on
death, for that <i>danse macabre</i> which troubled
the fancy of our forefathers is now danced
out, and the silent figure that knocks at
every door comes not as a grinning skeleton
but as one of more gentle countenance
than any art can express. The natural
change, which to William Blake was but
the passing out of one room into another, is
well personified in the merciful figure with
the kind eyes, coming at the sounded hour
to lead away into quietness. My solitude
has taught me to know well those noble
efforts which art has made to lift from our
bowed backs the burden of the fear of death:
I like to look upon that youthful Thanatos
carved upon a column from the temple of
the Ephesian Diana, and every year the red
leaves of autumn persuade my steps to that
village rich in elms where lived one who
also saw death so, and laboured to draw the
frightened eyes of men from the hour-glass
and the skull to the gracious vision of the
deliverer and friend. There hands which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
were dear to him have raised a place of
leave-taking upon a green slope, a house
of farewell set upon the shore to receive
the last pledges from the living to the
absolved and unburdened dead.</p>

<p>When first I saw Compton it was a
cloudless noon in August, the day of days
in which to come alone into this silent
place. Out of the fiery heat beaten from
wall and path like a blinding spray of light,
it is a passage into a dimness of cool space,
an air glaucous as the shade of olives.
There from the circuit of a dome look
down kind faces of immortal youth, in
form and habit too tranquil for our life,
but made homely to us by the mercy in
their eyes, and some quality of the white
soft hands which draws all weariness and
all pain towards them. To me it was as
though some furious struggle in the waves
were over, and swooning out of life I had
awakened upon a floor of translucent ocean,
where, in a gracious and tempered light,
beings of a compassion too intense for earth,
each with a gesture that was not yet a
touch, were charming all the bruises of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
lost battle away. Surely this is true vision
of things to come, and to such mercy we
shall awaken. It cannot be that when the
eyes reopen they shall see the forms of
dark apparitors, or that the ears shall hear
√Üacus and Rhadamanthys speaking in dim
halls their cold, irrevocable dooms. No,
but there shall be a pause and respite upon
the way from one to another life, and none
may be conceived more grateful than this
rest, as it were a sojourn beneath waters
of Euno√´, where a flood of dear memories
foreboding good shall absolve us from the
mortal sin of fear.</p>

<p>Turning back over these pages, I am
conscious that I have failed to give real
experiences their proper life. Describing
solitude I have been dull; I have fixed
the rushing flames of emotion in poor
flamboyant lines. I have written far more
than any reader but yourself will have cared
to follow; but now at any rate the confession
is over, and in the future I shall
work, and use my sight for a worthier end
than introspection. It has been said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the tale of any life is interesting if sincerely
told; and it may be that the most ordinary
lives have the advantage, because it is the
common experience which touches most
hearts. For the greater part mine has been
a common life, unglorified by hazards in
the field, or bright fulfilment of ambition;
it had been better for its peace
if it might wholly have kept the comfortable,
usual way.</p>

<p>I sometimes wonder whether the printing
of these pages will reveal to me any
kinsmen in affliction, for such there must
be going westward alone, and I wish that
for a moment we might foregather as we
pass, to compare the marvels of our isolation.
Then perhaps I might be urged to
higher effort, hearing stories more pitiful
than mine, tales of silent courage under
ban of excommunion to shame me from the
very thought of despair. Poets have metaphorically
given colours to souls; mine, I feel,
is only grey, the common hue of shadows;
but it was steeped in gloom by a veritable
pain and evils really undergone. And as
I reflect upon what I have written, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
try to imagine it read by some brisk person
utterly content with life, I can well understand
that the whole thing would appear
to him incredible, too preposterously strange
for belief, a rigmarole of sick fancies beyond
the power of hellebore. So be it: I expect
small comprehension and no mercy, for
indeed I have written caring little for such
consequence, yielding to that human thirst
for utterance which only confession can
slake; as one eases pain by a moan though
there are none to hear it. It is not
altogether a grateful task. For hardly,
and then only in a fortunate hour, to one
whose years and feelings have been interwoven
with his own, will even a healthy
man tell the tale of his hidden emotion;
and mine is the deeper reticence of a
habit which has ever held closely to
the recipe of fernseed. To entrust a
confidence to one of unproven sympathy,
is to risk a profitless embarrassment. It
has been most truly said that both parties
to such impulsive avowals, whenever they
afterwards meet, must feel a constraint as
of confederacy in misdemeanour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>I have hope that though I came late to
the steady labour of the vineyard, I may
yet earn my wage and begin the new day
with the rest. Like Joseph Poorgrass I
can now almost regard my diffidence as
an interesting study, and agree with the
rustic man of calamities that destiny might
have made things even worse. Certainly
the pain grows less fierce; I can go more
readily among my fellows for all but social
ends. For those who live much apart learn
at last to see men not as individuals but
in groups: to them it is the type which
counts, the <i>forma specifica per formam individualem
translucens</i>, of which the scholastic
jargon speaks. Those with whom I
come in casual contact appear to me now
in a vague, diffused light like the atmosphere
of some other world. Dwelling upon none
with the eyes of intimacy, and passing
swiftly from this to that, I find each but
the harmless variant of a species; if I
lingered or came too near, doubtless old
apprehensions would oppress me still. It is a
disadvantage of this outlook that the fascination
of detail is lost, and that I have less sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
for the personal in life. But if I grow old I
shall regain the interest in particular things
and persons with which age is consoled
amid many miseries; for while youth grows
earnest over some riddle of high art or the
occultation of Aldebaran, age is happily
absorbed in the arrangement of a room or
discussing the destinies of a single household.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, though uncongenial to my
kind as entering little into their pleasures,
I like to be near them in their grief or
happiness, standing unnoticed in the wind
of their fortune's wheel. At least I am
not soured or malevolent, and when there
is dancing toward, I am in the crowd upon
the margin of the green. I have abandoned
social obligations because I am unfitted to
perform them well, and society high and
low exists by their cheerful fulfilment.
But I no longer rail at social law or decline
to see anything but evil in conventions
devised by the wisdom and refinement of
centuries. If I refuse invitations and leave
calls unpaid, it is because I am socially
bankrupt: were I solvent I should redeem
all debts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>I decline therefore to denounce Chesterfield
and deify Thoreau: there was exaggeration
in both men, and though my
sympathies are rather with the recluse of
Walden pond, it is quite probable that
Chesterfield was the more useful of the
two. I am a bad player, I have not
the high spirits or the conversational skill
which each should contribute to the social
game. And in almost any sport the incompetent
confer a benefit by standing out:
at least, that is the opinion which I hear
the average player express. If I lived
in the backwoods where any guest is
welcome, it might be my duty to act
differently. But my ways are cast in
places where there is no need for social
press-gangs, and the highways and hedges
are left unsearched. If therefore by
abstention I gain a qualified peace for
myself, and confer positive benefit on
others, I may go my way without serious
reproach.</p>

<p>And I did wisely not to marry, for I
should have clung too closely to my study
for the happiness of any woman. I once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
saw an advertisement in the newspaper
inserted by a discontented young wife whose
husband was a recluse and would not take
her out of evenings. She wanted to communicate
with congenial people, and, like
a desperate sailor marooned, was driven to
wave her signal in the sight of the casual
eye. This frank confession of abandonment
made a profound impression upon
me. I thought to myself, "Master recluse,
you are a pilferer and have filched a life.
I am yet more solitary in my estate, and
if I followed your example, should be
guilty of a greater wrong." There are,
indeed, hours when I feel embittered at
the thought that for one innocent defect
a whole life should be amerced of joy; the
finality of loss appals: all is so irrevocable;
<i>le vase est imbib√©, l'√©toffe a pris son
pli</i>. Avoided not without cause by those
who were my natural associates, I grow
impenetrable of access, and even in my
own family unfamiliar. The resentment
that welled up in the man who told the
story of Henry Ryecroft obtains the mastery,
and I feel one in spirit with that lonely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
analyst of disillusions. Sometimes a worse
darkness gathers round, till I long for one
of those intense and all-absorbing creeds
which somehow seem to tend the brightest
hearth-fires which earth knows: for philosophy,
though it invented the void, never
built a little Gidding.</p>

<p>It is then that I feel like the suppliant
of the old Babylonian prayer, "one whose
kin are afar off, whose city is distant," and
all that appears before my sight is one
scroll of wrongs which this evil heritage
has inflicted upon me. It has made my
best years rich in misery; it has cut me
off from marriage; it has compelled me,
one hating vain complaint, to live querulously
in the optative mood. Neither
poverty nor sickness could chastise more
heavily; for poverty is strong in numbers
and sickness rich in sympathy, but diffidence
reaps laughter and is alone. When
such thoughts win dominion over the mind
I could envy what sufferer you will his
most awful punishment. For in his agony
be sure there is movement and action;
his limbs are torn, yet he is dragged on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>ward:
by his very writhing in the bonds
he confesses his life. But I lie in some
dead waste where nothing moves and all
is mist without horizon, lost in an abhorred
blankness of dismay to which no positive
suffering may be likened. Thither comes
no fierce provocation to quicken into
Promethean scorn; life lies whelmed in
blackness unlit by flashes of defiance or
the cold splendour of disdain.</p>

<p>Empedocles once described his dream of
retribution for the last unutterable offence.
For thrice ten thousand years the sinner
roams estranged from bliss, taking all
mortal shapes, wearing with tired feet all
the sad ways of life. √Üther sweeps him
out to Ocean, Ocean casts him naked on
the shores of Earth, Earth hurls him upward
to the flames of Helios, and he,
relentless, spurns the victim back to √Üther,
that the dread cycle may begin anew.
But to be for ever driven in this majestic
whirl of change, to receive the chastisement
of all elements and survive unbroken for
a new revolution of the wheel, this is but
an assurance of the very pride of life, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the charter of an invincible manhood. The
doom which in truth befits the unutterable
sin is rather the blank pain without accident
or period, without point or salience to
draw from stunned nature her last energies
of resentment. It is well for me that this
misery is short-lived, and that either by
thinking on that ideal love I know the
miracle of the twenty-ninth sonnet, or,
struggling with instant effort out of the
toils, try to see myself as I appear to
others, one who should scorn to sit in thirst
when there are wells yet for the seeking.</p>

<p>It is a strange life to lead in this pleasureful
world; and if when it is over I were
condemned to live again, coming like Er
the Armenian to that meadow where the
lots are thrown down for each to choose
his own, I am already decided what character
I should elect to play. I should
neither cast myself for a protagonist's part
nor again for that of a dumb actor in those
backgrounds I know too well; but just for
a plain manly character, strong to face all
fortunes and rich in troops of friends.
There should be no more evasion or dreary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
wrestling of mind with body; but life
should move to a restrained harmony, and
no elusive wind should carry half the
music away.</p>

<p>As for what remains of this present
dispensation, I shall know how to endure,
trusting that the years may fade finely,
like the figures in an old tapestry, and that
the end may come to me as to the old
gentleman in Hans Christian Andersen's
story of the Old House. And I have this
advantage over other men, that while they
have the whole cornucopia to lose, I can
but be deprived of the dregs in its pointed
end. For in what can there be further
punishment? On others, men of happy
pasts, dismay may fall as the ways are
darkened before them. But surely I shall
be of good cheer as I come into the land
of the fierce old robber Age; for, stripped
long since by a more subtle and insatiate
despoiler, I shall possess nothing of worth
to draw his covetousness upon me. So
many joys did my very youth renounce;
so many pleasures the Harpies swept from
my place at the spread board of life; such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
gags and fetters held me while others
danced and sang, that I was the sad familiar
of evil fortune before my companions were
acquainted with her name. That leaden
weight which brings others low, by a nice
adjustment of the scales shall raise me for
the first time to their equality. And then,
as one experienced in bereavements, of
themselves they may seek my company;
and I, so long the useless and estranged,
may become at the close their helpful
counsellor.</p>

<p>If only that might be; if only upon the
verge of night I might redeem by usefulness
my lost unserviceable day. Then this grey
life, so long sole and intrinsical to itself,
should glow at last with some reflection of
the sunset; once more I should know
young ardours imagined lost and devotions
miraculously born again.</p>

<p>You will still encounter me now and
then, moving absently through the crowd,
or wandering in some green place, as in
the garden of the Luxembourg Vauvenargues
used to meet the wounded of the
great battle, keeping apart in the narrower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
walks, and leaving the broad central ways
for lighter feet than theirs. He often
longed to have speech with them; but
always they turned away, with the proud
self-sufficiency of the disillusioned. Perhaps
if he had succeeded he would have
found that to some of them life had its
consolations not unlike mine, and that they
could still regard it as something more than
a friendly process of detachment. But it
is not our habit to expand; we are ever
held back by the occult pride which the
same soldier-philosopher has assigned to
one of his imaginary characters, "cette
fiert√© tendre d'une √¢me timide, qui ne
veut avouer ni sa d√©faite, ni ses esp√©rances,
ni la vanit√© de ses v&oelig;ux."</p>
